This is the amplified abstract generation dataset created for experiments presented in the paper titled "Amplifying Scientific Paper's Abstract by Leveraging Data-weighted Reconstruction".
The data consists of two datasets including AAN_data and Micro_data.
For each dataset, there are twenty-five directories, which contains:

- data.dat
Paper Title		Paper Conference		Paper Authors(Author1;Author2;Author3......)
Abstract/Citation Sentences

Note: the first two senteces of data.data are original scientific paper's metadata and abstract, while others are citing papers and citation sentences.

"standard" directory contains five standard summaries: worker_1.txt, worker_2.txt, ......, worker_5.txt, where are generated by five NLP background postgraduates.
Each worker_n.txt contains fifteen sentences selected from data.data (original abstract and citation sentences).
