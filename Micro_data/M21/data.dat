Title:Analysis of anchor text for web search		Conference:Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR		Author:Nadav Eiron;Kevin S. McCurley
It has been observed that anchor text in web documents is very useful in improving the quality of web text search for some classes of queries. By examining properties of anchor text in a large intranet, we hope to shed light on why this is the case. Our main premise is that anchor text behaves very much like real user queries and consensus titles. Thus an understanding of how anchor text is related to a document will likely lead to better understanding of how to translate a user's query into high quality search results. Our approach is experimental, based on a study of a large corporate intranet, including the content as well as a large stream of queries against that content. We conduct experiments to investigate several aspects of anchor text, including their relationship to titles, the frequency of queries that can be satised by anchortext alone, and the homogeneity of results fetched by anchor text.
