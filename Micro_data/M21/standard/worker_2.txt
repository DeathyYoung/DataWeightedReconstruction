It has been observed that anchor text in web documents is very useful in improving the quality of web text search for some classes of queries
By examining properties of anchor text in a large intranet, we hope to shed light on why this is the case
Our main premise is that anchor text behaves very much like real user queries and consensus titles
Thus an understanding of how anchor text is related to a document will likely lead to better understanding of how to translate a user's query into high quality search results
Our approach is experimental, based on a study of a large corporate intranet, including the content as well as a large stream of queries against that content
We conduct experiments to investigate several aspects of anchor text, including their relationship to titles, the frequency of queries that can be satised by anchortext alone, and the homogeneity of results fetched by anchor text
On the other hand, anchor texts resemble real-world user queries in terms of vocabulary distribution and length (Eiron and McCurley 2003), for example, they are both short and descriptive, which makes anchor texts have a better chance to match user queries than the content words of a Web page
Eiron and McCurley (2003) conclude that the main reason for the effectiveness of anchor texts in Web search is that they resemble real-world search queries in terms of term distribution and length
The aim was to see whether the effectiveness of anchor texts in document retrieval on the Web [10,15] can be carried over to expert finding on the two Website datasets
Anchor text is defined as the ¡°highlighted clickable text¡± that is displayed for a hyperlink in an HTML page [18]
We argue that the key features such as anchor text [13] and extracted title [18] used in relevance ranking should also be considered and employed in snippet generation
Nevertheless, anchor text is usually vague and imprecise to recognize user needs, especially if it consists only of a few words or even worse these words are for surfing support, e
It is observed [2] that queries submitted to search engines and anchor texts on hyperlinks could be taken as comments on page contents from users
Eiron and Mc-Curley [5] found, via an overlap metric, that anchor text and page titles tended to be drawn from the same conceptual space of words
This extends the ndings of existing research [11] which shows that anchor texts are close to real web queries in terms of term distribution and length, and shows the possibility of doing log-based research without proprietary data
