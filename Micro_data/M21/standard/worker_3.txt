It has been observed that anchor text in web documents is very useful in improving the quality of web text search for some classes of queries
By examining properties of anchor text in a large intranet, we hope to shed light on why this is the case
Our main premise is that anchor text behaves very much like real user queries and consensus titles
Thus an understanding of how anchor text is related to a document will likely lead to better understanding of how to translate a user's query into high quality search results
We conduct experiments to investigate several aspects of anchor text, including their relationship to titles, the frequency of queries that can be satised by anchortext alone, and the homogeneity of results fetched by anchor text
On the other hand, anchor texts resemble real-world user queries in terms of vocabulary distribution and length (Eiron and McCurley 2003), for example, they are both short and descriptive, which makes anchor texts have a better chance to match user queries than the content words of a Web page
Eiron and McCurley (2003) make a statistical analysis on anchor texts by comparing anchor texts of a Web page with its title and content
Eiron and McCurley (2003) conclude that the main reason for the effectiveness of anchor texts in Web search is that they resemble real-world search queries in terms of term distribution and length
There have also been studies showing that anchor text resembles real queries in terms of term distribution and length [11]
Sometimes, keywords for identifying a document¡¯s topic may even be missing in the document itself but exist in its anchor texts, e
We use this approach because anchor text is proven to be a good indicator about pages¡¯ contents and behaves as a ¡°consensus title¡± [18]
Nevertheless, anchor text is usually vague and imprecise to recognize user needs, especially if it consists only of a few words or even worse these words are for surfing support, e
It is observed [2] that queries submitted to search engines and anchor texts on hyperlinks could be taken as comments on page contents from users
3 million queries posed to a corporate intranet to the vocabulary of web page anchor text and found that the frequency of queries and query terms follows a tail-heavy power law [5]
For example, [2, 6, 10] have used hyperlinks and anchor text associated to hyperlinks as a succinct representation of the content of the target page
