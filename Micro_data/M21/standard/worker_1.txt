It has been observed that anchor text in web documents is very useful in improving the quality of web text search for some classes of queries
By examining properties of anchor text in a large intranet, we hope to shed light on why this is the case
Our main premise is that anchor text behaves very much like real user queries and consensus titles
Thus an understanding of how anchor text is related to a document will likely lead to better understanding of how to translate a user's query into high quality search results
We conduct experiments to investigate several aspects of anchor text, including their relationship to titles, the frequency of queries that can be satised by anchortext alone, and the homogeneity of results fetched by anchor text
Eiron and McCurley (2003) make a statistical analysis on anchor texts by comparing anchor texts of a Web page with its title and content
Eiron and McCurley (2003) conclude that the main reason for the effectiveness of anchor texts in Web search is that they resemble real-world search queries in terms of term distribution and length
This extends the ndings of existing research [11] which shows that anchor texts are close to real web queries in terms of term distribution and length, and shows the possibility of doing log-based research without proprietary data
In [10], Eiron and McCurley argue that the reason why anchortext is so effective for web search is because it provides a short and precise summarization of the target pages
¡± Assieme¡¯s method resembles the technique of anchor text indexing [10], which uses text of all incoming hyperlinks to index the target document
In general, there is an agreement that current techniques applied for traditional global Web search, such as anchor text information [10, 9], URL level [31] and link analysis [23, 14], have little contribution for the ranking quality when applied for small portions of the Web, which is the case of intrasite search

Anchor text associated with a hyperlink are usually brief keywords or phrases that describe the resource being referenced, and are often effective summaries of the resource [2, 5]
Eiron and Mc-Curley [5] found, via an overlap metric, that anchor text and page titles tended to be drawn from the same conceptual space of words
By its fundamental design, the Web links its resources together via hyperlinks, which are often annotated with ¡°highlighted clickable text¡± [5] called anchor text or link labels
