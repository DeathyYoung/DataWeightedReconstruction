It has been observed that anchor text in web documents is very useful in improving the quality of web text search for some classes of queries
By examining properties of anchor text in a large intranet, we hope to shed light on why this is the case
Our main premise is that anchor text behaves very much like real user queries and consensus titles
Thus an understanding of how anchor text is related to a document will likely lead to better understanding of how to translate a user's query into high quality search results
We conduct experiments to investigate several aspects of anchor text, including their relationship to titles, the frequency of queries that can be satised by anchortext alone, and the homogeneity of results fetched by anchor text
[6] argues that anchor text pointing to a page gives information ragarding the subject matter of that page, and relationships between different pages
Eiron and McCurley (2003) make a statistical analysis on anchor texts by comparing anchor texts of a Web page with its title and content
Anchor text is defined as the ¡°highlighted clickable text¡± that is displayed for a hyperlink in an HTML page [18]
[7] argues that anchor text pointing to a page gives information regarding the subject matter of that page, and relationships between different pages
It is observed [2] that queries submitted to search engines and anchor texts on hyperlinks could be taken as comments on page contents from users
A recent example where a major search engine started to incorporate query refinement in its search application is AltaVista¡¯s PrismaTMtool [1]
As Eiron argued in his paper [5], a searching procedure may be looked at as one way of building an optimized query formulation through an anchor text collection
[4] studi ed pages from the IBM intranet and found that anchor text resembles real-world queries in terms of it s term distribution and length
The following remarks address searching by queries, though they also apply to browsing in that navigational elements such as anchor texts share many characteristics with user queries and can be thought of as pre-formulated user queries (see [2])
While anchor text is not a substitute for full text indexing, it has proved to be remarkably effective in satisfying most web search queries [11, 14, 17]
