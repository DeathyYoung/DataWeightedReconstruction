It has been observed that anchor text in web documents is very useful in improving the quality of web text search for some classes of queries
By examining properties of anchor text in a large intranet, we hope to shed light on why this is the case
Our main premise is that anchor text behaves very much like real user queries and consensus titles
Thus an understanding of how anchor text is related to a document will likely lead to better understanding of how to translate a user's query into high quality search results
Our approach is experimental, based on a study of a large corporate intranet, including the content as well as a large stream of queries against that content
We conduct experiments to investigate several aspects of anchor text, including their relationship to titles, the frequency of queries that can be satised by anchortext alone, and the homogeneity of results fetched by anchor text
Eiron and McCurley (2003) conclude that the main reason for the effectiveness of anchor texts in Web search is that they resemble real-world search queries in terms of term distribution and length
The other way is to use statistics-based approach to achieve automatic recognition of unknown words, such as the name identification process using the Role Labeling [14]
Eiron and McCurley [8] investigated properties of anchor text in a large intranet and show its similarity with real user queries and consensus titles
We will study whether more effective ad hoc retrieval leads to better expert finding results, and vice versa, via background smoothing, and two document features
Eiron and McCurley found that the anchor text is typically less ambiguous than other types of texts; thus they can be used to produce a good representation for web pages [6]
Anchor text is useful for web search because it behaves as a ¡°consensus title¡± [18]
3 million queries posed to a corporate intranet to the vocabulary of web page anchor text and found that the frequency of queries and query terms follows a tail-heavy power law [5]
And also we observe that anchor texts in paths play the most important role for the tasks (this result is consistent with the observation in [16]), while the page titles and URL strings could also bring positive influence when combined
In [10], Eiron and McCurley argue that the reason why anchortext is so effective for web search is because it provides a short and precise summarization of the target pages
