Title:XRules: an effective structural classifier for XML data		Conference:Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD		Author:Mohammed Javeed Zaki;Charu C. Aggarwal
XML documents have recently become ubiquitous because of their varied applicability in a number of applications. Classification is an important problem in the data mining domain, but current classification methods for XML documents use IR-based methods in which each document is treated as a bag of words. Such techniques ignore a significant amount of information hidden inside the documents. In this paper we discuss the problem of rule based classification of XML data by using frequent discriminatory substructures within XML documents. Such a technique is more capable of finding the classification characteristics of documents. In addition, the technique can also be extended to cost sensitive classification. We show the effectiveness of the method with respect to other classifiers. We note that the methodology discussed in this paper is applicable to any kind of semi-structured data.

Title:Workload-Aware Clustering of XML Peers		Conference:		Author:Georgia Koloniari;Evaggelia Pitoura
...Peer clustering is based on rules that associate the presence of each path expression of a cluster description in the documents of the peers to the likelihood of the peer belonging to this cluster, an idea presented in XRules [25], a centralized algorithm for clustering XML data that uses discriminatory structural patterns to determine the cluster each document belongs to. Furthermore, clustering is adaptive in the sense that each cluster ......XRules [25] assigns the documents to categories through a rule based classification approach that relates the presence of a particular structural pattern in an XML document to its likelihood of belonging to a particular category......The clustering algorithm we apply on the peers is based on the idea presented in the XRules [25] centralized clustering procedure for XML documents...
