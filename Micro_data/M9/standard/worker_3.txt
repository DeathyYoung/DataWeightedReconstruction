Classification is an important problem in the data mining domain, but current classification methods for XML documents use IR-based methods in which each document is treated as a bag of words
In this paper we discuss the problem of rule based classification of XML data by using frequent discriminatory substructures within XML documents
An effective rule-based classifier for XML is XRules (Zaki & Aggarwal, 2003) , a method that uses a set of structural rules for XML document
XRules [55] assigns the documents to categories through a rule based classiflcation approach that relates the presence of a particular structural pattern in an XML document to its likelihood of belonging to a particular category
The XML data mining research can be divided in two main areas: mining frequent pattern from XML data [1,10] and classifying XML data [11,12]
Classication and clustering: The work presented in [17] uses a frequent tree mining algorithm to extract frequent substructures of XML data, the data is then classied according to its structure
In [17], a method is proposed that is based on the frequent sub-structures contained in XML documents
Tree mining can lead to many practical applications in the areas of computer networks [6], bioinformatics [7], [8], and XML documents databases mining [9], [10] and hence have received a lot of attention from the research community in recent years
Existing work on mining tree-structured data can be broadly classified into three categories: association rule mining [3], frequent substructure mining [2,15], and classification/clustering [10,16]
Zaki and Aggarwal [11] present an effective rule based classifier for XML data by using frequent discriminatory sub-structures within XML documents
The results are compared with the XRules structural classifier [30], which discovers association rules based on the algorithm for discovering frequent ordered embedded subtrees [12]
Structure only learning tasks on XML documents correspond to classification or clustering using the structural description of XML documents alone [35], [55], [8], [19], which can only apply to XML data sets that are naturally classified by structures
The discovered frequent substructures are further explored to improve other applications such as XML querying and XML classiflcation [11] etc
Recently, with the increasing amount of XML data available, knowledge engineering from XML data becomes an issue of great importance [1,5,9,10]
Therefore, we use another metric weighted confidence, defined in [9], which weighs the absolute support of a pattern in a class with the class probability
