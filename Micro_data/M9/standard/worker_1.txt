Classification is an important problem in the data mining domain, but current classification methods for XML documents use IR-based methods in which each document is treated as a bag of words
In this paper we discuss the problem of rule based classification of XML data by using frequent discriminatory substructures within XML documents
We note that the methodology discussed in this paper is applicable to any kind of semi-structured data
Another approach to complex-structured data is to use the pattern mining methods studied in the field of data mining [27,19]
Many XML documents are modeled as trees or graphs and it is important to build automated classifiers for XML data [43]
Since an XML document has a tree structure, we model it as a rooted ordered labeled tree [9] ,[10], [20], [21], [22] based on the structure and the content
XRules [25] assigns the documents to categories through a rule based classification approach that relates the presence of a particular structural pattern in an XML document to its likelihood of belonging to a particular category
Therefore, we use another metric weighted confidence, defined in [9], which weighs the absolute support of a pattern in a class with the class probability
We define approaches like the one introduced by Zaki [11], that finds all the frequent tree structures repeating in a collection, brute force approaches, while approaches like the one in [15], that finds only the frequent patterns corresponding to a certain XML structure, structure-based approaches
For example, recently, there has been increasing research efiort in mining association rules from XML documents[2]; classifying XML data [8] and clustering XML[9]
the XRULES classier [13], can be described as the association rule approach
We used two such approaches in our experiments that both come from the eld of using associative patterns for classication [6, 13]
In another example, Zaki and Aggarwal [28] presented an algorithm to classify XML documents according to their subtree structures
In [41], Zaki proposed an algorithm to construct structural rules in order to classify XML documents
Classication and clustering: The work presented in [17] uses a frequent tree mining algorithm to extract frequent substructures of XML data, the data is then classied according to its structure
