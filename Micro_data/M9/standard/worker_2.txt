Classification is an important problem in the data mining domain, but current classification methods for XML documents use IR-based methods in which each document is treated as a bag of words
In this paper we discuss the problem of rule based classification of XML data by using frequent discriminatory substructures within XML documents
Structure only learning tasks on XML documents correspond to classification or clustering using the structural description of XML documents alone [35], [55], [8], [19], which can only apply to XML data sets that are naturally classified by structures
The results are compared with the XRules structural classifier [30], which discovers association rules based on the algorithm for discovering frequent ordered embedded subtrees [12]
Please note that the XRules approach, consists of several phases namely the XMiner engine based on [12] which discovers the rules to be used for classification which then need to be evaluated by finding the default class in training and accuracy in testing, as discussed in [30]
XRules [9] extend TreeMiner to find all frequent trees, and it is cost-sensitive and uses Bayesian rule based class decision making
The first method is a naive approach to extend XRules [9] by adding content leaf nodes into XML structure trees without additional preprocessing
In order to mine XML data, a large amount of work, frequent substructure mining [1, 2, 3, 4], classification [5] and association rule mining [6], which focuses on the snapshot XML data has been done
Frequent tree mining is also found to be useful in analyzing XML repositories [44], in designing caching policies for XML indices [41], in designing automatic language parsers [8], in examining parse trees [4], and in many other applications
Mining tree-structured data has gained tremendous interest in recent times due to the widespread occurrence of tree patterns in applications like bioinformatics, web mining, semi-structured data mining, and so on
Existing work on mining tree-structured data can be broadly classified into three categories: association rule mining [3], frequent substructure mining [2,15], and classification/clustering [10,16]
1 Data Sets We performed the experiments on two real datasets namely the CSLOG dataset created and used by Zaki and Aggarwal [21] and a subset of the Wikipedia XML dataset [10]
The performance of this classifier is compared with Xrules [21] a rule based classifier for tree structured data and decision trees, that uses frequent patterns as binary features
As we reviewed in Section 2, XRULE [41] is a classifler that classifles XML documents according to the discriminatory structures extracted from each class of XML documents by some algorithm of frequent subtree mining
Many XML documents are modeled as trees or graphs and it is important to build automated classifiers for XML data [43]
