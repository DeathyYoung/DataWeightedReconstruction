This paper will focus primarily on one set of motivations for this theory, those engendered by attempts to handle certain syntactic phenomena within the framework of deterministic parsing
We have adopted, in this project, the straightforward view of incremental parsing as a process of repeatedly adding3 to partial structural descriptions of sentence-initial fragments (Barton & Berwick, 1985; Marcus, Hindle, & Fleck, 1983; Weinberg, 1993)
Grammar formalisms have been proposed that derive logical descriptions of trees representing the syntax of a string [15,23,26]
Pure dominance constraints are a fragment of dominance constraints with set operators [18, 3, 7] which have applications both in syntax and in semantics of computational linguistics [22, 12, 9]
The semantic component of a grammar usually outputs representations which at least determine truth-conditions, but we shall move from truth-conditions to descriptions of truth-conditions, just as Marcus et al
This "core parser" has been the subject of a number of computational implementations, including Marcus's deterministic parser (1980), Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983)), and Abney's licensing based model (1987, 1989)
The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node
Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck (1983) have introduced Description Theory (D-theory) which considers the structure of trees in terms of the domination relation rather than the parent relation
As noted in (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983; Marcus, 1987), this approach is capable of maintaining Marcus' deterministic hypothesis (Marcus, 1980) in a number of cases where the original deterministic parsers fail
The parser used by our semantic interpreter leaves structural syntactic relations underspecified along the lines of D-Theory (Marcus, Hindle, & Fleck 1983) and minimal commitment parsers (Weinberg 1993)
Berwick and Weinberg (1985) suggested tht one can dispense with lookahead by adopting an underspecified representation like that proposed in Barton and Berwick (1985) and Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck (1983)
The use of domination has found a number of applications, such as in deterministic parsers based on Description theory (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983), in a compact organization of the basic structures of Tree-Adjoining Grammars (Vijay-Shanker & Schabes, 1992), and in a new characterization of the adjoining operation that allows a clean integration of TAGs into the unification-based framework (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) Our logic serves
Finally, the tools of formal language theory are inadequate to describe at a sufficiently abstract level formalisms that are based on the simultaneous solution of sets of constraints [9,10]
Literature on parsing natural language has recently been concerned with topics which are unfamiliar to traditional Computational Linguistics such as functional similarities of different syntactic constructions (I), reanalysis of 'indelible' structures (9), manipulation of 'indelible' trees (7)
The most basic formulas of CLLS are dominance constraints (Marcus et al
