Linguists, including computational linguists, have always been fond of talking about trees
In this paper, we outline a theory of linguistic structure which talks about talking about trees; we call this theory computational
This paper will focus primarily on one set of motivations for this theory, those engendered by attempts to handle certain syntactic phenomena within the framework of deterministic parsing
We have adopted, in this project, the straightforward view of incremental parsing as a process of repeatedly adding3 to partial structural descriptions of sentence-initial fragments (Barton & Berwick, 1985; Marcus, Hindle, & Fleck, 1983; Weinberg, 1993)
In this paper we express dominance constraints [15,19,4,5,1] in stratified context unification (CU) [20,13]
Grammar formalisms have been proposed which derive logical descriptions of trees representing the syntax of a string [18, 22, 8]
Pure dominance constraints are a fragment of dominance constraints with set operators [18, 3, 7] which have applications both in syntax and in semantics of computational linguistics [22, 12, 9]
(1983), where certain parsing anomalies were avoided by taking descriptions of phrase structure trees, not the trees themselves, as the output of a parsing algorithm
The "D-theory" approach of Marcus, Hindle, & Fleck (1983), in which the parser maintains a description of the utterance being parsed, seems especially amenable to formulation as a logical system
(1983) assumes that raising revisions are always costly, because they involve destruction of domination relations between nodes
The parser used by our semantic interpreter leaves structural syntactic relations underspecified along the lines of D-Theory (Marcus, Hindle, & Fleck 1983) and minimal commitment parsers (Weinberg 1993)
The semantic component of a grammar usually outputs representations which at least determine truth-conditions, but we shall move from truth-conditions to descriptions of truth-conditions, just as Marcus et al
In computational linguistics, the importance of dominance based tree descriptions for deterministic parsing was discovered at the beginning of the eighties [9]
This approach amounts to the strategy sometimes known as Reanalysis As a Last Resort(RALR) (Fodor & Frazier, 1980; Frazier, 1990; Frazier & Clifton, 1998); it also appears under the heading of monotonic parsing (Gorrell, 1995; Marcus, Hindle, & Fleck, 1983; Weinberg, 1993), and it has been implemented in activation-based parallel models in the form of lateral inhibition mechanisms (Vosse & Kempen, 1999)
For an interestingly different reason, a preference for local attachment in (3) is also predicted by a number of proposals in the framework of D(escription)-theory (Marcus et al
