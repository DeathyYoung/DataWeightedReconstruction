Title:D-theory: talking about talking about trees		Conference:Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics - ACL		Author:Mitchell P. Marcus;Donald Hindle;Margaret M. Fleck
Linguists, including computational linguists, have always been fond of talking about trees. In this paper, we outline a theory of linguistic structure which talks about talking about trees; we call this theory computational. This paper will focus primarily on one set of motivations for this theory, those engendered by attempts to handle certain syntactic phenomena within the framework of deterministic parsing.

Title:Talking about Trees and Truth-Conditions		Conference:		Author:Reinhard Muskens
...The basic idea underlying this model derives from work in computational syntax in the early eighties (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982; Marcus et al., 1983) and is sometimes called the Description Theory of linguistic representation......in Marcus et al. (1983), where certain parsing anomalies were avoided by taking descriptions of phrase structure trees, not the trees themselves, as the output of a parsing algorithm......The semantic component of a grammar usually outputs representations which at least determine truth-conditions, but we shall move from truth-conditions to descriptions of truth-conditions, just as Marcus et al. (1983) moved from trees to descriptions of trees......This work is not only based on LTAGs, but also on the pioneering Marcus et al. (1983), already mentioned in the introduction...

Title:Grammatical Search and Reanalysis		Conference:		Author:David Schneider;Colin Phillips
...This approach amounts to the strategy sometimes known as Reanalysis As a Last Resort(RALR) (Fodor & Frazier, 1980; Frazier, 1990; Frazier & Clifton, 1998); it also appears under the heading of monotonic parsing (Gorrell, 1995; Marcus, Hindle, & Fleck, 1983; Weinberg, 1993), and it has been implemented in activation-based parallel models in the form of lateral inhibition mechanisms (Vosse & Kempen, 1999)......For an interestingly different reason, a preference for local attachment in (3) is also predicted by a number of proposals in the framework of D(escription)-theory (Marcus et al., 1983)......An interesting proposal made in the context of D(escription)-theory (Marcus et al., 1983) is that the reanalysis in (1) is not really a reanalysis at all, since the change at the underlined verb in (1) only requires monotonic addition of new dominance relations...

Title:Incorporating "Unconscious Reanalyses" into an Incremental, Monotonic Parser		Conference:		Author:Patrick Sturt
...This "core parser" has been the subject of a number of computational implementations, including Marcus's deterministic parser (1980), Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983)), and Abney's licensing based model (1987, 1989)......This model is interesting in that it does not allow the parser to employ delay tactics, such as using a lookahead buffer (Marcus (1980), Marcus et al (1983)), or waiting for the head of a phrase to appear in the input before constructing that phrase (Abney (1987, 1989), Pritehett (1992))......The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node......ZNote that in Marcus et al (1983), since precedence relations were not computed for non-terminals, lowering into a predecessor was possible, thus (11) would cause no processing difficulty...

Title:Connectionist syntactic parsing using temporal variable binding		Conference:		Author:James Henderson I

Title:Reasoning with Descriptions of Trees		Conference:Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics - ACL		Author:James Rogers;K. Vijay-Shanker
...The use of domination has found a number of applications, such as in deterministic parsers based on Description theory (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983), in a compact organization of the basic structures of Tree-Adjoining Grammars (Vijay-Shanker & Schabes, 1992), and in a new characterization of the adjoining operation that allows a clean integration of TAGs into the unification-based framework (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) Our logic serves ......Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck (1983) have introduced Description Theory (D-theory) which considers the structure of trees in terms of the domination relation rather than the parent relation......As noted in (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983; Marcus, 1987), this approach is capable of maintaining Marcus' deterministic hypothesis (Marcus, 1980) in a number of cases where the original deterministic parsers fail...... a". In these structures the left-of relation is no longer partial, ie: for all pairs a, b either every tree described by the quasitree satisfies "a is left-of b" or none of them do. This is not acceptable for D-theory, where both the analyses of "pseudo-passives" and coordinate structures require single structures describing sets including both trees in which some a is left-of b and others in which the same a is either ......Thus the tree we extract is both the circumscriptive reading of (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) and the standard referent of (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983)...
