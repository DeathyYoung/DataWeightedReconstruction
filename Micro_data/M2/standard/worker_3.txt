This paper describes a system that leads us to believe in the feasibility of constructing natural spoken dialogue systems in task-oriented domains
It specifically addresses the issue of robust interpretation of speech in the presence of recognition errors
Robustness is achieved by a combination of statistical error post-correction, syntactically- and semantically-driven robust parsing, and extensive use of the dialogue context
We present an evaluation of the system using time-to-completion and the quality of the final solution that suggests that most native speakers of English can use the system successfully with virtually no training
This is the model that details all the possibilities that can occur in the simulation Although being examined in particular are semi-structured dialogues such as conversations and interviews, the modeling of these types of simulations are considerably complex [1]
, systemically analyzed the plan recognition theories, techniques and methods
As stated by Allen [3], two methods can be considered for processing NL commands: the top-down and the bottom-up approach
The other goal is the modification of the natural language processing capabilities into speaker-independence for limited domains and vocabularies, and the processing of spoken language [10] (cf
Alternatively, the system developer might pursue the more rigorous approach based on discourse theory, attempting to model in the implemented system an understanding of the purpose behind the user’s utterance { whether it is a query, a conrmation and so on { and then getting the system to respond appropriately (Allen, Miller, Ringger and Sikorski 1996)
As pointed out in [AMRS96] it is better to have a dialogue system that tries to guess a specificinterpretation in case of ambiguity rather than ask the user for a clarification
[1], do display advanced dialogue capabilities, such as employing user-modeling and domain reasoning
Our approach is related to other recent work on incremental language processing for dialogue systems (Allen et al
There has been much related work on implementing collaborative dialogues in the context of specific applications, based either on discourse planning techniques (Chu-Carroll & Carberry 1995; Ahn et al
, 1996) would respond to this apparently contradictory sequence of commands by sending the very same train, our enhanced HCI system notes the contradiction, and, by assessing the problem, identifies a possible mistake in its choice of referent for ‘the Boston train’
Like (Brick and Scheutz, 2007) we analyze an utterance for its meaning, not just for syntactic structure (Allen et al
