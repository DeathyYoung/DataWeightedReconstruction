Title:Planning, Executing, Sensing, and Replanning for Information Gathering		Conference:International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence - IJCAI		Author:Craig A. Knoblock
Current specialized planners for query processingare designed to work in local, reliable, andpredictable environments. However, a numberof problems arise in gathering information fromlarge networks of distributed information. Inthis environment, the same information may residein multiple places, actions can be executedin parallel to exploit distributed resources, newgoals come into the system during execution,actions may fail due to problems with remotedatabases or networks, and...
