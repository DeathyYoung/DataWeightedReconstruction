Title:A Comparison of String Distance Metrics for Name-Matching Tasks		Conference:International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence - IJCAI		Author:William W. Cohen;Pradeep Ravikumar;Stephen E. Fienberg
Using an open-source, Java toolkit of name-matching methods, we experimentally compare string distance metrics on the task of matching entity names. We inves- tigate a number of different metrics proposed by differ- ent communities, including edit-distance metrics, fast heuristic string comparators, token-based distance met- rics, and hybrid methods. Overall, the best-performing method is a hybrid scheme combining a TFIDF weight- ing scheme, which is widely used in information re- trieval, with the Jaro-Winkler string-distance scheme, which was developed in the probabilistic record linkage community.

...The ne ighbor search algorithm has three phases: In the initialization phase, two similarity measures are applied to the input ontologies: name similarity (using Levenshtein distance) [6] and linguistic similarity (using WordNet) [7] and based on these, two similarity matrices are obtained......We know that if we use other similarity measures like Monger-Elkan distance function [8], or Jaro metric [9, 10], or Jaro-Winkler metr ic, which can produce better results [6] than Levenshtein similarity distance, we can get better candidate result's states...

...Typically, a dataspace system employs a set of mechanisms for semantic integration, such as schema matching [25] and entity resolution [7], to determine semantic equivalences between elements in the dataspace......references are about the same real-world entity [7]......From this library, we use the SoftTFIDF approach [7], a hybrid approach combining the Jaro-Winkler metric [36] (a measure based on how many characters the strings have in common and their ordering) with TF-IDF similarity......This mechanism was shown to have the best string matching accuracy in a variety of experiments [7]...
