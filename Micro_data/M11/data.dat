Title:Optimizing search engines using clickthrough data		Conference:Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD		Author:Thorsten Joachims
This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.

...strategies such as [1], [2], [8], [10], [13], [15], [17], [18] employed a single large user profile for each user in the personalization process......Document-based profiling methods try to estimate users‚Äô document preferences (i.e., users are interested in some documents more than others) [1], [2], [8], [10], [15], [18].1 On the other hand, concept-based profiling methods......Personalization strategies such as [10], [15], [18] include negative preferences in the personalization process, but they all are document-based and thus cannot reflect users‚Äô general topical interests......‚Ä¢ While document-based user profiling methods pioneered by Joachims [10] capture users‚Äô document preferences (i.e., users consider some documents to be more relevant than others), our methods are based on users‚Äô concept preferences (i.e., users consider some topics/concepts to be more relevant than others)......Several personalized systems that employ clickthrough data to capture users‚Äô interest have been proposed [1], [2], [10], [15], [18]......Joachims [10] proposed a method which employs preference mining and machine learning to model users‚Äô clicking and browsing behavior......After the document preference pairs are obtained, a Ranking SVM (RSVM) [10] is employed to learn the user behavior model as a set of weighted features......Joachims [10] assumed that a user would scan the search results from top to bottom......Proposition 1, a ranking SVM algorithm [10] is employed to learn the user‚Äôs preferences, which is represented as a weighted concept vector...

The document preference pairs are then employed in a ranking SVM algorithm [9] to learn a linear feature weight vector, which is composed of either content or location concept features, to rank the search results according to the user‚Äôs content and location preferences......Ranking SVM [9] is employed in our personalization approach to learn the user‚Äôs preferences...
