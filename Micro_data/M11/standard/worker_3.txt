This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data
Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below
While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts
The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking
Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions
From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework
It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples
We then attempt to learn a linear SVM-based scoring function that reflects these preferences, using the implementation of ordinal ranking in the SVMlight toolkit (Joachims 2002)
In addition to QE, search logs have also been used for other Web search tasks, such as document ranking (Joachims 2002; Agichtein et al
,The web community has long recognized the importance of clicks as a source of signal for learning relevance, and there are many studies on how to learn relevance in the presence of position bias [2, 7, 11]
, [6, 7, 17, 19, 22, 31]) are designed to optimize loss functions loosely related to the IR performance measures, not loss functions directly based on the measures
RankSVM [5] is an algorithm designed for such a problem, which converts a ranking problem to a classification problem and optimizes it with existing solvers
Machine-learned ranking refers to the automatic construction of a ranking function which optimizes retrieval performance metrics [4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 21, 23, 16]
Implicit user feedback, specically, click-through data, is valuable for optimizing search engine results [2, 10, 14]
After the document preference pairs are obtained, a Ranking SVM (RSVM) [10] is employed to learn the user behavior model as a set of weighted features
