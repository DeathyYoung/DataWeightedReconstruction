This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data
Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below
While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts
This makes them difficult and expensive to apply
The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking
Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost
Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions
From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework
Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features
The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment
It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples
, [6, 7, 17, 19, 22, 31]) are designed to optimize loss functions loosely related to the IR performance measures, not loss functions directly based on the measures
In particular, preferences between documents [10] and between document lists [18] can be inferred and have been shown to contain sufficient information for learning effective ranking functions [9]
Using a data set of name-alias pairs, we train a ranking support vector machine [24] to rank candidate aliases according to their strength of association with a name
Using the regularization term will (1)impose smoothness conditions on possible solutions; (2)make the algorithm select a w resulting in a largest margin, which depicts the distance between the closest two projections within all target rankings geometrically [3]
