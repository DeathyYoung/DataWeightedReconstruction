Libraries have traditionally used manual image annotation for indexing and then later retrieving their image collections
However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content
Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images
We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs
Blobs are generated from image features using clustering
Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image
Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for the task of image annotation and retrieval
Such a system, which models visual structure as a mixture of features, can represent complex objects as the co-occurrence of distinctive parts within an image [6], [8], [13], [17], [21], [23]
Many algorithms have been proposed for automatic image tagging, varying from building classiflers for individual semantic labels [13, 14] to learning relevance models between images and keywords [15, 16]
The crossmedia relevance model (CMRM) assumes that images may be described from small vocabulary of blobs and learns the joint distribution of blobs and words from a training set of annotated images [17]
The aforementioned annotation methods may also be categorized into two branches; region-based requiring a preliminary step of image segmentation [12, 13], and holistic [8, 21] operating directly on the whole image space
A cross-media relevance model is used in [10], which finds annotated images in the training set that are similar to the query image and uses their annotations for the query image
The approach was originally developed for alleviating the problem of vocabulary mismatch in Information Retrieval [6], and has since been applied to problems ranging from automatic tagging of images [4] to recovering missing values in database records [9]
[5] proposed cross-media relevance model (CMRM) to estimate the joint probability of keywords and image using discrete blobs to represent regions
Automatic Image Annotation(AIA) has attracted a great deal of research interests [11,7,6,10,13], due to its critical role in keyword based image retrieval and browsing
