Title:Fast Planning Through Planning Graph Analysis		Conference:International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence - IJCAI		Author:Avrim Blum;Merrick L. Furst
We introduce a new approach to planning in STRIPS-like domains based on con- structing and analyzing a compact structure we call a Planning Graph. We describe a new planner, Graphplan, that uses this paradigm. Graphplan always returns a shortest- possible partial-order plan, or states that no valid plan exists. We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also give empir- ical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new perspective on the planning problem.
