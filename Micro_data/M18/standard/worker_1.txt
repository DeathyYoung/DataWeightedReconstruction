We introduce a new approach to planning in STRIPS-like domains based on con- structing and analyzing a compact structure we call a Planning Graph.
Graphplan always returns a shortest- possible partial-order plan, or states that no valid plan exists.
We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. 
Heuristics derived from planning graphs [4] are widespread in planning
This is done by a Graphplan-like procedure [1], which due to the absence of deletes constructs a planning graph with no mutexes, from which a plan FF(s) is extracted backtrack-free [11]...
Graphplan [2] is a general-purpose planner for STRIPS-like domains, which exploits the benefits of graph algorithms in order to reduce search space and provide better solutions
Since FIP uses planning graphs to conduct a search, the size of the planning graph and the time required to expand it are polynomial in the size of the planning problem [1]...
We carried out this evaluation by integrating the usage of tractable class into the GraphPlan based planning algorithm (Blum and Furst, 1997)
Many centralized techniques and popular planners for functional planning, such as [1] [8], employ Planning graph that is a special graph based representation for a plan
Possible candidate action sequences of the graph are then searched backward to form a final plan [1
His technique is inspired by work of Blum and Furst (1997) on planning, which exploits the construction and the analysis of graphs of goals without the need of a plan hierarchy
The disadvantage of the latter of these approaches is that it ignores any positive interactions (shared actions) between the action sequences for each goal: it is this problem which was addressed by the heuristic used in FF. 
Extensions of GRAPHPLAN: the use of planning graphs [1] has also been extended to temporal problems by several planners
Graphplan (Blum and Furst 1997) and Blackbox (Kautz and Selman 1997) have introduced two fundamental concepts to planning with discrete actions
An LA-graph can be seen as a variant of the well-known planning graph [3] representation for propositional (STRIPSlike) planning problems
