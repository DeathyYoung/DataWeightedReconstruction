The dialogue manager merges information from the input devices with the history and the discourse model [16,17]
As described in [19], a grounding model has been developed based on the verbal and nonverbal signals happening during human– human interactions
A study by Nakano and colleagues [79] revealed that an ECA with a grounding mechanism seems to encourage more non-verbal feedback from the user than a system without any grounding mechanism
Grounding is also present during interactions with embodied conversational agents, and human participants naturally head nod as a non-verbal feedback for grounding [20]
2-1 MACK was designed to study face-to-face grounding [69]
Nakano and colleagues [14] developed a engagement model for the kiosk agent Mack that provides route directions for a paper map
[17] designed a life-like agent (Mack) that provides the user with directions on a (shared) physical map, and derives information about the user’s conversational state from gaze behavior
Nakano and colleagues [25] explored the relation between various dialogue acts and non-verbal behaviors and showed that speakers look at their partners in order to ground references to new entities
We investigate the verbal and nonverbal means for Based on these results, we present an ECA that uses verbal and nonverbal grounding acts to update dialogue state
Compositional DRT [Muskens(1996)], employed to underpin the PTT dialogue framework [Poesio & Rieser(2009)]
Previous studies in multimodal user interfaces and intelligent virtual agents presented many interesting applications by exploiting such sensing technologies [1, 2]
In Mack [21], the authors achieved natural nonverbal grounding via a statistical model conducted from the results of Wizard-of-Orz (woz) experiments
Eye gaze for an utterance is selected according to a statistical model based on utterance type and the context This more general method is supported by work such as [7], which links gaze behaviors to utterance types
[40] suggested that in a face-to-face conversation non-verbal signals as well as verbal signals participate in the grounding process to indicate that an utterance is grounded or needs further work to become grounded
IRIs appear to be important interaction patterns in conversation [17], and indicators of the instructor being conceived of as a social actor
