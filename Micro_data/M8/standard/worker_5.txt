We investigate the verbal and nonverbal means for Based on these results, we present an ECA that uses verbal and nonverbal grounding acts to update dialogue state
In addition, direction-followers in that study attempted to establish eye contact with direction-givers more often at points of confusion or potential trouble (see also Nakano, Reinstein, Stocky, & Cassell, 2003)

[7]) reported on the use of the listener’s gaze and the lack of negative feedback to determine whether the listener has grounded [8] the speaker’s turn
Many other experiments showed the effectiveness of utilizing facial expression, gaze and gestures for communication purposes [6]
Experimental studies [24, 34] have indicated that simply linking remote spaces through audio-visual video links (as opposed to audio-only) does not improve collaborative performance, especially not to the levels observed in copresent collaboration [18, 26]
The MACK system described in [5] uses a head tracker to determine a user’s gaze in a direction-giving task, whereby an animated agent monitors lack of negative feedback and positive feedback in the grounding process
The dialogue manager merges information from the input devices with the history and the discourse model [16,17]
To build systems which accomplish such multimodal interactions, some studies discussed computational models of multimodal interactions [3, 4]
Nakano et al [9] found that gaze at a map and lack of negative feedback were indicative that humans considered the previous utterance grounded and only looked at the interlocutor when they required more information to ground
Empirical studies show that the visual access to the interlocutor’s body affects the conversation in the way that non-verbal behaviors are used as communicative signals (Nakano et al
A study by Nakano and colleagues [27] revealed that an ECA with a grounding mechanism seems to encourage more non-verbal feedback from the user than a system without any grounding mechanism
While some systems [12, 2] have incorporated tracking of fine motion actions or visual gesture, none have included top-down dialogue context as part of the visual recognition process
And indeed, a number of studies of face to face interaction between an user and an ECA have confirmed that this tendency exists (e
2 Nakano and colleagues ([15]) have shown how the user’s engagement can be measured by analyzing his gaze behavior during an interaction with the MIT Information Kiosk agent MACK
