2 Nakano and colleagues ([15]) have shown how the user’s engagement can be measured by analyzing his gaze behavior during an interaction with the MIT Information Kiosk agent MACK
MACK (Media lab Autonomous Conversational Kiosk) is an embodied conversational agent (ECA) that relies on both verbal and nonverbal signals to establish common ground in computer– human interactions [19]
Nakano et al [9] found that gaze at a map and lack of negative feedback were indicative that humans considered the previous utterance grounded and only looked at the interlocutor when they required more information to ground
analyzed eye gaze and head nods in computer–human conversation and found that their subjects were aware of the lack of conversational feedback from the ECA [23]
Empirical studies show that the visual access to the interlocutor’s body affects the conversation in the way that non-verbal behaviors are used as communicative signals (Nakano et al
Finally, gaze as basic turn-taking and grounding cue [16] and emblematic manual gestures like shrug are to be incorporated
We investigate the verbal and nonverbal means for Based on these results, we present an ECA that uses verbal and nonverbal grounding acts to update dialogue state
[17] proposed a gaze model for nonverbal grounding in conversational agents, and, using a head tracker, implemented an agent that can judge whether the information provided from the agent is grounded
In Mack [21], the authors achieved natural nonverbal grounding via a statistical model conducted from the results of Wizard-of-Orz (woz) experiments
Previous NLP research on gesture has largely focused on building recognizers for gestures that characterize specific language phenomena: for example, detecting hand gestures that cue sentence boundaries (Chen et al
[40] suggested that in a face-to-face conversation non-verbal signals as well as verbal signals participate in the grounding process to indicate that an utterance is grounded or needs further work to become grounded
The timing of gesture stroke relative to utterance was also coded as: before utterance, beginning of utterance (first three words), ending of utterance (last 3 words), middle of utterance, or continued from previous utterance (following [26])
Gaze serves a number of functions like feedback, directing attention, showing interest, or turn taking
A study by Nakano and colleagues [79] revealed that an ECA with a grounding mechanism seems to encourage more non-verbal feedback from the user than a system without any grounding mechanism
Grounding is also present during interactions with embodied conversational agents, and human participants naturally head nod as a non-verbal feedback for grounding [20]
