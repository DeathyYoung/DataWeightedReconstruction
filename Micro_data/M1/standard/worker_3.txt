We propose a formal model of Cross-Language Information Retrieval that does not rely on either query translation or document translation
Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language
The model integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion in a unified formal framework
We describe how the topic model can be estimated with either a parallel corpus or a dictionary
We test the framework by constructing Chinese topic models from English queries and using them in the CLIR task of TREC9
The model achieves performance around 95% of the strong mono-lingual baseline in terms of average precision
Lavrenko and et al [11] adapted the relevance model (Model 1) in two ways to perform CLIR, both based on the KL-divergence scoring function
Translation probabilities are widely used in CLIR for handling translation ambiguities or are even built as a part of the statistical language modeling for CLIR [6, 9, 14]
[14] use either parallel corpora or a bilingual lexicon to estimate a relevance model between two languages, and the model is used for QE and disambiguation
At present, query translation has become the most popular technique for CLIR [6]
It has been shown that expanding the query (for example, as in relevance models [9]) remediates this eect by making the probability distribution of the words in the query more comparable to the probability distribution of the words in the document
Recently the language modeling technique has been introduced to information retrieval area and shown considerable success in many applications [15-19]
The task of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) addresses a situation when a query is posed in one language but the system is expected to return the documents written in another language [11]
Other methods include the cross-lingual relevance model [14], which integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion
Here we present an approach to retrieving handwritten historical documents from a single author, using a relevance-based language model [11, 12]
