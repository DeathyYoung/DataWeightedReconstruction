We propose a formal model of Cross-Language Information Retrieval that does not rely on either query translation or document translation
Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language
The model integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion in a unified formal framework
The main contribution of this work is the unified formal model which integrates techniques that are essential for effective Cross-Language Retrieval
In the second category, researches have attempted to apply the statistical Language Model (LM) to CLIR [8-10]
Previous work has demonstrated that parallel corpus could be used as a way to find word pairs in different languages [4, 5, 6]
Adding the translated queries with relevant terms (known as query expansion) has been shown to improve CLIR effectiveness [1, 3]
Motivated by earlier works[20][4][12] , we use a generative model to estimate the probability that a document in one language is relevant, given a query in another language
Methods based on parallel corpora, such as relevance language models (Lavrenko, Choquette, & Croft 2002) and statistical translation models (Kraaij, Nie, & Simard 2003; Xu & Weischedel 2001), usually learn an association between words in the source language and the target language, and apply the association to estimate translations of queri es
In language model sub-runs, query expansion was carried out using relevance modeling [13]
Apart from translation methods, there exist few non-translation methods, such as cognate matching [2], latent semantic indexing [10], and relevance models [4]
The task of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) addresses a situation when a query is posed in one language but the system is expected to return the documents written in another language [11]
Translation probabilities are widely used in CLIR for handling translation ambiguities or are even built as a part of the statistical language modeling for CLIR [6, 9, 14]
Lavrenko et al [10] applied language model for cross language information retrieval using parallel corpus
The former approach uses the Relevance Model technique to compute the language model of the training questions assigned to each answer and compares it to the language model of the test question
