We propose a formal model of Cross-Language Information Retrieval that does not rely on either query translation or document translation
Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language
The main contribution of this work is the unified formal model which integrates techniques that are essential for effective Cross-Language Retrieval
Translation probabilities are widely used in CLIR for handling translation ambiguities or are even built as a part of the statistical language modeling for CLIR [6, 9, 14]
Some methods for CLIR based on corpus that have been reported are relevance model techniques by Victor Lavrenko [10], combination approach for multilingual information retrieval by Martin Braschler [3] and bilingual corpora for translingual information retrieval by Yiming Yang et al
Apart from these approaches, the extension of monolingual IR techniques such as vector based models, relevance modeling techniques [4] etc
Adding the translated queries with relevant terms (known as query expansion) has been shown to improve CLIR effectiveness [1, 3]
[11] proposed a cross-lingual information retrieval model based on relevance models [12]
It has been shown that expanding the query (for example, as in relevance models [9]) remediates this eect by making the probability distribution of the words in the query more comparable to the probability distribution of the words in the document
Other methods include the cross-lingual relevance model [14], which integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion
Some recent projects applied crosslingual approaches to environments with very few or none training documents in a language for which documents need be classified [2, 8]
Apart from translation methods, there exist few non-translation methods, such as cognate matching [2], latent semantic indexing [10], and relevance models [4]
Specifically, our work departs from the original relevance model [6] and its cross-lingual counterpart [5] in the way Dirichlet priors are associated with the both representations
The task of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) addresses a situation when a query is posed in one language but the system is expected to return the documents written in another language [11]
However, all these methods are very time-consuming and itâ€™s hard to acquire large parallel bilingual corpus, especially of minor languages
