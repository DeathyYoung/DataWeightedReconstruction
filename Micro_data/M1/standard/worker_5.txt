We propose a formal model of Cross-Language Information Retrieval that does not rely on either query translation or document translation
Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language
The model integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion in a unified formal framework
We describe how the topic model can be estimated with either a parallel corpus or a dictionary
We test the framework by constructing Chinese topic models from English queries and using them in the CLIR task of TREC9
The main contribution of this work is the unified formal model which integrates techniques that are essential for effective Cross-Language Retrieval
Finally, Croft [17] used a unified formal model using language modeling, he also integrated query expansion to solve one of the most difficult problems in IR (disambiguation), he implemented his model on a parallel bilingual corpus
Our proposed framework was greatly inspired by the recent advances on language modeling applications in information retrieval, including relevance models [6,5], model-based feedback [10], and Bayesian language model [9]
Translation probabilities are widely used in MLIA for handling translation ambiguities or are even built as a part of the statistical language modeling for MLIA [2, 9, 10]
Previous work has demonstrated that parallel corpus could be used as a way to find word pairs in different languages [4, 5, 6]
Apart from these approaches, the extension of monolingual IR techniques such as vector based models, relevance modeling techniques [5] etc
Relevance models, a technique borrowed from information retrieval [6, 5] surprisingly outperformed SVM’s (classification accuracy of 79
Methods based on parallel corpora, such as relevance language models (Lavrenko, Choquette, & Croft 2002) and statistical translation models (Kraaij, Nie, & Simard 2003; Xu & Weischedel 2001), usually learn an association between words in the source language and the target language, and apply the association to estimate translations of queri es
Conventionally CLIR approaches [4,7,8,12,21] have focused mainly on incorporating dictionaries and domain-specific bilingual corpora for query translation [6,10,18]
[12] suggest a reasonable way to approximate P(w|R) by using a joint probability of observing the word w together with query words q1, …, qm (Q = q1, …, qm):
