We propose a formal model of Cross-Language Information Retrieval that does not rely on either query translation or document translation
Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language
The model integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion in a unified formal framework
Besides, language model approaches have been adopted in many other information retrieval applications such as document retrieval [16][17], cross-linguistic retrieval [19], distributed IR [20], passage retrieval [21], topic tracking [22], and so on
The task of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) addresses a situation when a query is posed in one language but the system is expected to return the documents written in another language [11]
The other two systems are based on the statistical language modeling techniques used recently in mono-lingual (LM) and cross-lingual information retrieval (CLM) [2, 3]
Apart from these approaches, the extension of monolingual IR techniques such as vector based models, relevance modeling techniques [5] etc
Methods based on parallel corpora, such as relevance language models (Lavrenko, Choquette, & Croft 2002) and statistical translation models (Kraaij, Nie, & Simard 2003; Xu & Weischedel 2001), usually learn an association between words in the source language and the target language, and apply the association to estimate translations of queri es
Recently the language modeling technique has been introduced to information retrieval area and shown considerable success in many applications [15-19]
Document language models will be constructed and ranked with respect to the estimate of the relevance model, for example by using the KL-divergence as in [5]
[12] use the KL divergence between the relevance model and the document model to rank documents
As suggested in [16], we use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between passage language model P M and question-topic language model R M to rank passages
instead builds a “relevance model” in the target language based on a source language query [33]
Apart from translation methods, there exist few non-translation methods, such as cognate matching [2], latent semantic indexing [10], and relevance models [4]
These approaches have successfully been applied to CLIR setting [12] [11] [20], which treat query translation and retrieval as an integrated process
