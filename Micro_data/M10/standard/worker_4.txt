In this paper, we propose a new approach to discover informative contents from a set of tabular documents (or Web pages) of a Web site
Our system, InfoDiscoverer, first partitions a page into several content blocks according to HTML tag in a Web page
Based on the occurrence of the features (terms) in the set of pages, it calculates entropy value of each feature
According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block, the entropy value of the block is defined
By analyzing the information measure, we propose a method to dynamically select the entropy-threshold that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant
Informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page, whereas redundant content blocks are common parts
That is, using the approach, informative blocks (news articles) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as advertisements, banners, navigation panels, news categories, etc
[19] proposed algorithms to extract content blocks from HTML pages using a DOM (Document Object Model)-based approach and an information theoretic approach, respectively
Template detection algorithms [23, 33, 21, 10, 7, 9] are a different approach to content extraction in which collections of training documents based on the same template are used to learn a common structure
This technique can be used as a preprocessing tool for information extraction, classifying the segmented blocks into informative blocks that contain the page¡¯s core contents and noise blocks that contain irrelevant information such as menus, advertisements, or copyright statements [2],[3]
DOM supplies us with a tree-like page model, which is helpful to construct q block tree [6, 7]
We mention only a few solutions: Lin and Ho developed InfoDiscoverer [3] which is based on the idea, that ¨C opposite to the main content ¨C template generated contents appear more frequently
Lin & Ho [7] developed an approach to extract relevant information blocks out of Web documents by defining entropy blocks based upon occurrence of given terms
Based on various other frameworks but also only dealing with structured or semi-structured texts, we can cite Pinocchio or (LP)2 by Ciravegna [10¨C12], the WhizBang site wrapper from Cohen [13], the Wrapper Induction systems of Kushmerick [21, 22], Bouckaert¡¯s system based on Baeysian networks [4], Yang¡¯s system [32] or Lin¡¯s work [24] to design wrappers induced from Web pages
Block importance model is motivated by the urge to improve information retrieval performance, thus its direct application lies in this area [1][10]
