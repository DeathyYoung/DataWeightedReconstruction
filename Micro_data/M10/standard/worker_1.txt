In this paper, we propose a new approach to discover informative contents from a set of tabular documents (or Web pages) of a Web site
Our system, InfoDiscoverer, first partitions a page into several content blocks according to HTML tag in a Web page
Based on the occurrence of the features (terms) in the set of pages, it calculates entropy value of each feature
According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block, the entropy value of the block is defined
By analyzing the information measure, we propose a method to dynamically select the entropy-threshold that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant
Informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page, whereas redundant content blocks are common parts
[19] proposed algorithms to extract content blocks from HTML pages using a DOM (Document Object Model)-based approach and an information theoretic approach, respectively
In particular, Lin assumed that the <TABLE> tag is widely used to make the structure of a Web page, and proposed a method primarily using the <TABLE> tag to extract blocks from a Web page [3]
Current research uses priori knowledge or supervised learning to detect frequent templates [2], coherent content blocks [15], and site style trees [35]
Most approaches used priori knowledge or supervised learning to detect coherent content blocks [6] and site style tree [7]
Entropy measures [6] and "visually" based methods [7] have been devised for identifying content blocks
For example, Lin and Ho (2002) extract content blocks based on a similar document analysis approach, but their classification is based on entropy values
The structure-based IE [4, 7-9] relies on inherent structural features of HTML documents, such as informative content blocks [8, 10-14] and content template [15-18]
The format detection also applies to information retrieval [3], discovering important content blocks [11], eliminating noisy information from Web pages [8,14], Web page clustering and classification [14], and information extraction [2,4©\7,10,13]
According to the statistic in [17], large percent of web pages are organized with <TABLE >< \ TABLE> tags as to support their presentation layouts (70% for dot-com web pages, and 55% for dot-edu web pages)
