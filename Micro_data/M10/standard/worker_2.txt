In this paper, we propose a new approach to discover informative contents from a set of tabular documents (or Web pages) of a Web site
Our system, InfoDiscoverer, first partitions a page into several content blocks according to HTML tag in a Web page
Based on the occurrence of the features (terms) in the set of pages, it calculates entropy value of each feature
According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block, the entropy value of the block is defined
By analyzing the information measure, we propose a method to dynamically select the entropy-threshold that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant
Informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page, whereas redundant content blocks are common parts
Most of web sites employ visible and invisible tables in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to arrange their logical structures by using HTML table tags [18]
That is, using the approach, informative blocks (news articles) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as advertisements, banners, navigation panels, news categories, etc
[19] proposed algorithms to extract content blocks from HTML pages using a DOM (Document Object Model)-based approach and an information theoretic approach, respectively
Earlier work on web content extraction is dominated by the construction of wrappers [12] ¨C handcrafted solutions which exploit properties of the document object model (DOM), either on page-level, by applying tag-based heuristics [7, 6], or on site-level, by identifying frequent patterns, or templates [15, 14, 23]
One of common web segmentation techniques is the VIPS algorithm [5] which segments web pages based on visual representation
In [6], only <TABLE> tag is used to partition a page into several blocks, its offspring as a content block and it uses entropy based approach to discover informative ones
There are three methods to compare content: (1) compare the shingle (flngerprint of a string) of the content [1, 2]; (2) compare the keywords [3]; (3) exactly match the contents by word [4]
Entropy analysis proposed in [21] discriminates the informative authorities of pages by dividing a page into several authority blocks with different authority values weighted by the information of each block
The study of block importance model is mainly motivated by the urge to improve Web information retrieval performance, thus its direct application lies in the area [1][11]
