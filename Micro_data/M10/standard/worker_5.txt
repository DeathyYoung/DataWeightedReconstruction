In this paper, we propose a new approach to discover informative contents from a set of tabular documents (or Web pages) of a Web site
Our system, InfoDiscoverer, first partitions a page into several content blocks according to HTML tag in a Web page
Based on the occurrence of the features (terms) in the set of pages, it calculates entropy value of each feature
According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block, the entropy value of the block is defined
That is, using the approach, informative blocks (news articles) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as advertisements, banners, navigation panels, news categories, etc
Regarding the method used for the information block discovery, most the existing approaches are based on some predefined heuristic rules used for recognizing block purpose [2], [4], [1]
There are some solutions [18,19,2,5] proposed to analyze Web sites and divide their pages into logical blocks from HTML DOM tree
Entropy analysis proposed in [18] discriminates the informative authorities of pages by dividing a page into several authority blocks with different authority values weighted by the information of each block
The DOM tree is a tree that represents the structure of a Web page and is usually adopted in research related to the analysis of page structure [13, 10]
There are at least two main modern branches of algorithms for content retrieval from HTML pages: methods based on DOM tree analysis [7, 12, 10], and methods based on HTML page visual representation [5, 10, 3, 11]
Most of web sites employ visible and invisible tables in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to arrange their logical structures by using HTML table tags [18]
Current research used priori knowledge or supervised learning to detect frequent templates [6], coherent content blocks [7] and site style tree [8] tied to this task
In recent years, several similar research studies have been done on Web page cleaning, including detection of informative blocks in Web pages [5], detection of a frequent template or patterns of Web pages [6], and assignment of different weights to different blocks in Web pages [7], etc
A common approach to reconstruct such structures is Web page segmentation, which has been proved effective to improve mobile browsing experience [1, 4, 7], and can also benefit Web information retrieval and data mining tasks [2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
Template detection algorithms [23, 33, 21, 10, 7, 9] are a different approach to content extraction in which collections of training documents based on the same template are used to learn a common structure
