Title:A New Statistical Parser Based on Bigram Lexical Dependencies		Conference:Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics - ACL		Author:Michael John Collins
This paper describes a new statistical parser which is based on probabilities of dependencies between head-words in the parse tree. Standard bigram probability estimation techniques are extended to calculate probabilities of dependencies between pairs of words. Tests using Wall Street Journal data show that the method performs at least as well as SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94), which has the best published results for a statistical parser on this task. The simplicity of the approach means the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes. With a beam search strategy parsing speed can be improved to over 200 sentences a minute with negligible loss in accuracy.

The table also shows that using the modification distance probability (BM-âˆ†+MDP) is better than using the distance measure as in [6] (BM)......âˆ†, OC, and MDP stands for distance measure used in [6], outer context, and modification distance probability......They are parsers from [6] and [11] 7 .
