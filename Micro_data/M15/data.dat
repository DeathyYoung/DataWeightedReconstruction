Title:Web question answering: is more always better?		Conference:Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR		Author:Susan T. Dumais;Michele Banko;Eric Brill;Jimmy J. Lin;Andrew Y. Ng
This paper describes a question answering system that is designed to capitalize on the tremendous amount of data that is now available online. Most question answering systems use a wide variety of linguistic resources. We focus instead on the redundancy available in large corpora as an important resource. We use this redundancy to simplify the query rewrites that we need to use, and to support answer mining from returned snippets. Our system performs quite well given the simplicity of the techniques being utilized. Experimental results show that question answering accuracy can be greatly improved by analyzing more and more matching passages. Simple passage ranking and n-gram extraction techniques work well in our system making it efficient to use with many backend retrieval engines.

Title:Self-learning web question answering system		Conference:World Wide Web Conference Series - WWW		Author:Dmitri Roussinov;Jose Antonio Robles-Flores
...Dumais et. al [2] presented a Web based QA system that uses simple combinatorial permutations of words (so called ‚Äúrewrites‚Äù) and a set of 15 handcrafted semantic filters to achieve a striking accuracy: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.507, which can be roughly interpreted as ‚Äúin average‚Äù the correct answer being the second answer found by the system......Our work expands [2] by allowing automatic identification and training a set of patterns, which are more powerful than simple re-writes......If there fewer than expected (here 200) candidate answers found , the algorithm resorts to a ‚Äúfall back‚Äù approach as in [2]: it creates candidate answers from each sentence of the snippets returned by GPSE and applies answer detailing to them . If there are still not enough candidates, the system automatically relaxes the modulated query (by removing most frequent on the Web words first) until enough many hits are returned by GPSE......We did not involve any manually crafted semantic filters reported in prior studies [2] such as those dealing with numbers, proper names, and monetary values......We went one step further than using frequency counts explored earlier in [2] and tried a more fine-grained triangulation process......We achieved mean reciprocal rank of the answer (MRR) of 0.314, which is smaller than reported in [2], but seemingly better (although not directly comparable due to different testing methodologies) to the results reported with the other approaches [3][1] that were completely trainable (not relying on hand -crafted rules)......We believe that the lower results are due to our use of AltaVista instead of Google and due to the fact that we did not use any manually crafted semantic filters. Without them, [2] reported MRR of 0.416...

...Meanwhile, the QA community, building on top of Information Retrieval (IR) systems, part-of-speech and namedentity (NE, e.g., people, place, time) taggers, and shallow parsers, has made substantial advances in building highaccuracy QA systems [3, 8, 9, 11, 5, 18, 26, 6, 16]......Notable departures from the standard paradigm include inferring paraphrases [13], predicting answer tokens from question features [1, 6], and using a language model conditioned on the question type [23]...

Recent research in question answering systems has looked at systems for answering fact-based, short-answer questions such as ‚ÄúWho killed Abraham Lincoln? ‚Äùo r ‚ÄúHow tall is Mount Everest?‚Äù While many systems use sophisticated natural language technologies to tackle this problem, some researchers have used much simpler techniques (Brill et al., 2001; Clarke et al., 2001; Dumais et al., ...
