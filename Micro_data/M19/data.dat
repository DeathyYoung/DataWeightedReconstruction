Title:Discriminative Training and Maximum Entropy Models for Statistical Machine Translation		Conference:Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics - ACL		Author:Franz Josef Och;Hermann Ney
We present a framework for statistical machine translation of natural languages based on direct maximum entropy mod- els, which contains the widely used sour- ce-channel approach as a special case. All knowledge sources are treated as feature functions, which depend on the source language sentence, the target language sentence and possible hidden variables. This approach allows a baseline machine translation system to be extended easily by adding new feature functions. We show that a baseline statistical machine transla- tion system is significantly improved us- ing this approach.

This approach has been suggested by (Papineni et al., 1997; Papineni et al., 1998) for a natural language understanding task, by (Beyerlein, 1998) for an ASR task, and by (Och and ...
