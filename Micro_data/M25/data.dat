Title:Noun Classification from Predicate-Argument Structures		Conference:Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics - ACL		Author:Donald Hindle
A method of determining the similarity of nouns on the basis of a metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in a large text corpus is described. The resulting quasi-semantic classification of nouns demonstrates the plausibility of the distributional hypothesis, and has potential application to a variety of tasks, including automatic indexing, resolving nominal compounds, and determining the scope of modification.

The second measure is based on the mutual information measure and was used by (Hindle, 1990) for discovering groups of similar terms......However, as our as well as many other approaches (compare (Hindle, 1990; Pereira et al., 1993; Grefenstette, 1994)) do not produce appropriate names for the abstract concepts produced by FCA and the other clustering algorithms, it seems difficult to assess the validity of a given sub-/superconcept relation......Furthermore, we have shown that the conditional probability performs reasonably well as information measure compared to other more elaborate measures such as the ones used by (Hindle, 1990) or (Resnik, 1997)......One of the first works on clustering nouns was the one by (Hindle, 1990), in which nouns are grouped into classes according to the extent to which they appear in similar verb frames...

... subclass relationships in noun compounds of the form <instance-name> <class-name>, as in "Unix operating system" and "C language." Unfortunately, noun compounds are also employed to express numerous other relationships, as in "Unix kernel" and "C debugger." We have found, however, that collocational evidence can be employed to suggest which noun compounds reflect taxonomic relationships, using a ......Hindle 1990). We do the same for each noun Ni. Under the assumption that instance and class nouns are likely to co-occur with the same verbs, we compute a similarity score between T and each noun Ni, by summing the product of the mutual information values for those verbs occurring with both nouns......Hindle (1990) reports interesting results of this kind based on literal collocations, where he parses the corpus (Hindle 1983) into predicate-argume nt structures and applies a mutual information measure (Fano 1961; Magerman and Marcus 1990) to weigh the association between the predicate and each of its arguments...

Title:Refining Automatically-Discovered Lexical Relations: Combining Weak Techniques for Stronger Results		Conference:		Author:Marti A. Hearst;Gregory Grefenstette
...The work reported here attempts to find semantic similarity among terms based on the contexts they tend to occur in; (Church & Hanks 1990) uses frequency of co-occurrence of content words to create clusters of semantically similar words, (Hindle 1990) uses both simple syntactic subject-verb-object frames and frequency of occurrence of content words to determine similarity among nouns, and (Calzolari & Bindi 1990) use corpus-based ...
