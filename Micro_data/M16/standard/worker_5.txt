This paper addresses the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant documents
It argues that relevance and redundance should each be modelled explicitly and separately
The experimental results demonstrate that the cosine similarity metric and a redundancy measure based on a mixture of language models are both effective for identifying redundant documents
In information retrieval, where novelty typically refers to the new information contained in the document (and is thus close to our definition of serendipity), Zhang et al
Specifically, we used cosine similarity, which had been shown to work effectively in [39], to remove near duplicate documents of which the similarity score passes a pre-specified redundancy threshold
presented four redundancy measures, which are ¡°set difference¡±, ¡°geometric distance¡±, ¡°distributional similarity¡± and ¡°a mixture model¡± [7]
On the other hand, if we wish to find out how well the system can detect non-novel or redundant documents, redundancyprecision (RP), redundancy-recall (RR) and redundancy Fscore (RF) can be used instead [16]
In order to meet user needs in diversity, the recommendation list of relevant visual documents should be diversified [2], [21]
The most related work to our research in novelty/redundancy detection at the document and sentence level are [4,6,7]
Novelty/redundancy detection has been explored in text information retrieval from the event level [4, 33] to the document/sentence level [3, 39]
As demonstrated in [13], cosine similarity is effective on information novelty detection and outperforms KL divergence in several experiments
In this paper, we focus on document-level novelty detection, which identifies novel documents from a given group of relevant documents [29]
Similarly, other work has incorporated the notion of novelty detection into information filtering, with the goal of finding documents that not only fit a user¡¯s pro file but that also contain novel information that the user has not yet seen [11]
[13] Novelty and redundancy detection distinguishes among relevant documents that contain new (novel) information and relevant documents that do not
For filtering these redundant documents, novelty-detection researchers [21] define a novel document as a document that includes new information that is relevant according to the user profile
