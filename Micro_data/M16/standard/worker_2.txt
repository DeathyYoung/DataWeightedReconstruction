This paper addresses the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant documents
It argues that relevance and redundance should each be modelled explicitly and separately
The experimental results demonstrate that the cosine similarity metric and a redundancy measure based on a mixture of language models are both effective for identifying redundant documents
presented four redundancy measures, which are ¡°set difference¡±, ¡°geometric distance¡±, ¡°distributional similarity¡± and ¡°a mixture model¡± [7]
The importance of enhancing diversity in ranking has been recognized in various contexts, including novelty detection [20], subtopic retrieval [18], diversifying search results [1, 6], recommender systems [25], and so on
The simple similarity method [16] and the overlap method [15] are based on the one-to-one comparison paradigm, while the all-to-one paradigm is adopted for the simple pool method [15] and the interpolated aggregate smoothing language model [1]
Shrinkage smoothing increases the probability of features that occur frequently in the topic or in the collection if they occur less frequently in story, while mixture model decreases the probability of these features [4]
Novelty and redundancy detection has been mainly explored at three different levels: the event level [3], document level [6, 29, 33] and sentence level [2]
similarity score between a sentence and a given query will increase the relevance rank of the sentence while a high similarity score between the sentence and all previously seen sentences will decrease the novelty rank of the sentence, for example, the Maximal Marginal Relevance model (MMR) introduced by Carbonell and Goldstein [23]
We use MMR as our fourth and main baseline because MMR was reported to work well in non-redundant text summarization [23], novelty detection at document filtering [13] and subtopic retrieval [17]
Novelty detection could be also performed at the level, for example, in Zhang et al¡¯s [13] on novelty redundancy detection in adaptive and in Zhai et al¡¯s [17] on subtopic In current techniques developed for novelty detection at the level or document new words appearing in sentences/doc ents usually contribute to the scores that are used to rank nts
Research on novelty detection at the sentence level is related to the TREC novelty track for finding relevant and novel sentences given a topic and an ordered list of relevant documents [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 23]
Although cosine distance has performed very well as a novelty measure in past research that assigned novelty scores to full documents [14], its performance is known to degrade substantially on shorter pieces of text
For filtering these redundant documents, novelty-detection researchers [21] define a novel document as a document that includes new information that is relevant according to the user profile
Similarly, other work has incorporated the notion of novelty detection into information filtering, with the goal of finding documents that not only fit a user¡¯s pro file but that also contain novel information that the user has not yet seen [11]
