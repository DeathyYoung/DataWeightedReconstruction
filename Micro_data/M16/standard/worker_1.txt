This paper addresses the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant documents
It argues that relevance and redundance should each be modelled explicitly and separately
The experimental results demonstrate that the cosine similarity metric and a redundancy measure based on a mixture of language models are both effective for identifying redundant documents
In information retrieval, where novelty typically refers to the new information contained in the document (and is thus close to our definition of serendipity), Zhang et al
Here, we use a mixture language model [31] to measure the similarity between documents while filtering out the general and common information from the request
This may be due to the effectiveness of cosine similarity for redundancy detection [39], which often brings redundant documents to the top position
Most work boils down to balancing relevance and novelty in an ad-hoc way, such as the two-state novelty detection approach proposed in [39]
presented four redundancy measures, which are ¡°set difference¡±, ¡°geometric distance¡±, ¡°distributional similarity¡± and ¡°a mixture model¡± [7]
If R is the set of documents which have been judged relevant to the user¡¯s interest, and F is the set of documents which make up the current filtering result for the interest, then the set DK = R [ F can be considered as the set of documents currently ¡®¡®known¡¯¡¯ to the user
Another work based on novelty is [19], which aims at enhancing adaptive filtering systems with the capability of distinguishing novel and redundant items
In order to alleviate such inconsistency, similar to [33], we classified news stories into three classes in this paper: completely redundant, somewhat redundant, and novel
Moreover, we adopt to use the two smoothing techniques to adjust the MLE to assign non-zero probabilities to unseen tokens to make KL-based measure more appropriate as used by [35]:
More recently, work on filtering technologies in the context of information retrieval [14] has also focused attention on building better models of the likely content in messages and routing them to appropriate people, bringing together work on user modeling, IR, and text analysis
From previous studies [2,29], we learn that the cosine distance metric showed a good performance on both document and sentence-level novelty detection
[3] emphasize that finding a suitable redundancy threshold is an important, yet challenging problem, since the amount of training data is typically extremely small
