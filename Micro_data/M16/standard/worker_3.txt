This paper addresses the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant documents
It argues that relevance and redundance should each be modelled explicitly and separately
In information retrieval, where novelty typically refers to the new information contained in the document (and is thus close to our definition of serendipity), Zhang et al
Here, we use a mixture language model [31] to measure the similarity between documents while filtering out the general and common information from the request
where KL is the Kullback¨CLeibler divergence (which is a distributional similarity measure [32]) and ¦ÈC(di) is the context model for di
By measuring the novelty of an incoming document we want to gauge the quantity of new information that a document provides, relative to the currently known information about an interest (Gabrilovich et al
834 We use MMR as a baseline because MMR was reported to work well in non-redundant text summarization 835 (Carbonell & Goldstein, 1998), novelty detection at document filtering (Zhang, Callan et al
in [25] address the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant items in the context of document retrieval
Existing methods to improve diversity in ranking include maximum marginal relevance (MMR) (Carbonell & Goldstein, 1998), cross-sentence informational subsumption (Radev, 2000), mixture models (Zhang et al
news novelty, intended as the amount of novel content in the news with respect to the contents of the already analysed news [25]
We use MMR as our fourth and main baseline because MMR was reported to work well in non-redundant text summarization [23], novelty detection at document filtering [13] and subtopic retrieval [17]
[31] They estimate language models in a layered fashion by first defining the background language model, and then defining document models or relevance models using standard expectation maximization (EM-) estimation [2] taking the fixed background and a fixed mixture parameter into account
[33] indicated that although similarity such as cosine similarity was proven to be effective experimentally [29], when one sentence¡¯s meanings were covered by another, this relation is not necessarily symmetric, because sentences may contain multiple meanings
Of course, both paradigms of relevance and novelty are not objective, but depend on the actual user (and even on her current context and specific information needs
In this work, the authors suggested that the tasks of topic detection and novelty detection are tangential, and thus require different modeling and computational techniques
