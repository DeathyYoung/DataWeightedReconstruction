Title:Novelty and redundancy detection in adaptive filtering		Conference:Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR		Author:Yi Zhang;James P. Callan;Thomas P. Minka
This paper addresses the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant documents. It argues that relevance and redundance should each be modelled explicitly and separately. A set of five redundancy measures are proposed and evaluated in experiments with and without redundancy thresholds. The experimental results demonstrate that the cosine similarity metric and a redundancy measure based on a mixture of language models are both effective for identifying redundant documents.

Title:Evaluating Recommendation Systems		Conference:		Author:Guy Shani;Asela Gunawardana
...One approach would be to consider novelty only among the relevant items [63]......In information retrieval, where novelty typically refers to the new information contained in the document (and is thus close to our definition of serendipity), Zhang et al. [63] suggested to manually label pairs of documents as redundant......Other researchers [17] compare algorithms by evaluating the portion of users whose private information was compromised......Another alternative is to define different levels of privacy, such as k-identity [17], and compare algorithms sensitivity to privacy breaches under varying levels of privacy...

...Here, we use a mixture language model [31] to measure the similarity between documents while filtering out the general and common information from the request......As shown in Fig. 3, each relevant case can be generated by the mixture of a general English model Œ∏E, a user-specific request model Œ∏R, and a document context model Œ∏C .T he probabilities of a word wi in a case generated by the language models are ŒªE, ŒªR, and ŒªC, respectively [31]......where KL is the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence (which is a distributional similarity measure [32]) and Œ∏C(di) is the context model for di. Œ∏E, Œ∏R, and Œ∏C can be trained using the expectation‚Äìmaximization algorithm, which is widely used to fit language models [31], [33], [34]...

...Since it is well known that some retrieval functions, e.g., cosine similarity, are also effective measures for novelty and redundancy detection [39, 3], it would be critical to investigate the performance of these measures with ‚Äúdual-roles‚Äù in the relatedness function......We follow the two stage approach proposed in [39] to first use a standard information retrieval model to retrieve a set of documents by taking the seed article as a query, and then remove relatively obvious redundant articles......Relevance and novelty measures have been well studied [28, 33, 24, 39, 3], but it is not clear how well they would work in a unified relatedness function......In fact, many retrieval functions, e.g., cosine similarity, are also effective measures for novelty and redundancy detection [39, 3]. Therefore, we do not distinguish relevance and novelty and use the same set of features for capturing both of them, leaving the machine learning algorithm to balance their ‚Äúdual-roles‚Äù......[34], mainly because it has also been shown to be one of the most effective measures for novelty detection [39]......Next, we did a simple redundancy detection using the twostage approach proposed in [39] to filter out relatively obvious redundancy......Specifically, we used cosine similarity, which had been shown to work effectively in [39], to remove near duplicate documents of which the similarity score passes a pre-specified redundancy threshold......This may be due to the effectiveness of cosine similarity for redundancy detection [39], which often brings redundant documents to the top position......One possible explanation is that cosine similarity is also very effective in redundancy and novelty detection [39]......Existing studies in novelty detection, e.g., [8, 39, 37, 3], often aim to locate relevant and novel information through finding a tradeoff between relevance and novelty......Most work boils down to balancing relevance and novelty in an ad-hoc way, such as the two-state novelty detection approach proposed in [39]...

...The first contribution to the study of large scale text novelty detection (experiments were performed on a document level novelty detection dataset) was made by [7]......In Zhang Yi‚Äôs pioneering work on Novelty [7], several questions (discrepancies between theory and observations) were raised regarding the redundancy measure and the novelty detection procedure: symmetric or asymmetric redundancy measure, sentence-to-sentence or sentence-to-multiple-sentences comparison model......Although similarity has been proven to be effective experimentally [7] [5], if we think twice, when one sentence‚Äôs meanings are covered by another, this relation is not necessarily symmetric, because sentences may contain different numbers of meanings......An asymmetric overlap measure should be used eventually, ([6] [7] mentioned such belief)......Surprisingly, in spite of the theoretical advantage of overlap, similarity is empirically better than asymmetric methods like the overlap method, as experimental results from [6] [7] indicated......Redundancy-Mistake measure in [7] - an increase in SPSM always corresponds to a decrease in the Redundancy-Mistake......Till this point we have both theoretically and empirically answered the questions in the introduction proposed by [7]: symmetric or asymmetric measure (the SPSM evaluation for similarity and overlap pointed out where the problem truly lies: the evaluation method; symmetric measures are not always better under SPSM), one-to-one or one-to-multiple comparison (the selected pool method solved the mystery of this discrepancy between theory and ......This nature of the novelty task has answered the questions (surprising discrepancies between theory and observation) proposed by [7]...

...An interesting alternative estimation approach is suggested by Jin et al. [7], Zhai and Lafferty [30] and Zhang et al. [31] They estimate language models in a layered fashion by first defining the background language model, and then defining document models or relevance models using standard expectation maximization (EM-) estimation [2] taking the fixed background and a fixed mixture parameter into account......In this paper we systematically explore the use of parsimonious models at a number of stages in the retrieval process, combining the work of several relevance model approaches [11, 30, 31]......To model the fact that a relevant document might talk about other topics than the topic that makes it relevant, we actually need not a two-level but a three-level structure:1) a whole-collection or generic model P (t|C); 2) modified by a relevance model P (t|R); 3) modified by an individual document model P (t|D) [31]...

[33] indicated that although similarity such as cosine similarity was proven to be effective experimentally [29], when one sentence‚Äôs meanings were covered by another, this relation is not necessarily symmetric, because sentences may contain multiple meanings......In this paper, we focus on document-level novelty detection, which identifies novel documents from a given group of relevant documents [29]......From previous studies [2,29], we learn that the cosine distance metric showed a good performance on both document and sentence-level novelty detection......Three public datasets APWSJ [29], TREC Novelty Track 2004 [16], and TREC Novelty Track 2003 [17] are selected as our experimental datasets......In our experiments, we adopt the strict definition used in [29] where only absolute redundant documents are regarded as non-novel......Because there are a large number of novel documents in APWSJ, we use redundancyprecision ( RP ), redundancy-recall ( RR ), and redundancy precision-recall (R- PR )c urve to evaluate the performance of document-level novelty detection on APWSJ [29]...
