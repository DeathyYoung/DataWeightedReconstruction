We introduce the contour spectrum, a user interface component that improves qualitative user interactionand provides real-time exact quantification in the visualizationof isocontours. 
The contour spectrum is asignature consisting of a variety of scalar data and contourattributes, computed over the range of scalar valuesw 2 !. 
We explore the use of surface area, volume, and gradient integral of the contour that are shown to be univariate B-spline functions of the scalar value w for...

Harish Doraiswamy,?et al. Output-Sensitive Construction of Reeb Graphs ...They serve as an effective user interface for selecting meaningful level sets [13], [14] and for designing transfer functions for volume rendering [15], [16], [17], [18]...
Bajaj et al. [1] propose a data-driven technique which evaluates statistical information about area and gradient magnitude of the isosurfaces contained in the data
Bajaj et al. show how statistical analysis can drive the creation of transfer function lookup tables [1]
The contour spectrum algorithm computes metrics over the data values of a dataset and the resulting spectrum is displayed within the user interface as a collection of signature curves, each representing a different attribute ? Bajaj et al. 
The display [1] of the Contour Tree provides the user with direct insight into the topology of the field and reduces the user interaction time necessary to ¡°understand¡± the structure of the da
A more data-centric approach is the Contour Spectrum [1], which visually summarizes the space of isosurfaces in terms of metrics like surface area and mean gradient magnitude, thereby guiding the choice of isovalue for isosurfacing, and also providing information useful for transfer function generation
Bajaj et al. [2] discuss using other volume function information to find isovalues of interest; these functions include the volume enclosed by an isosurface, the isosurface area, and the isosurface gradient
Isovalue-dependent statistics are introduced in [5], where surface area, volume, and gradient integral of contours are plotted to provide the user quantitative measures for parameter selection
...Bajaj et al. [2] showed contour trees and geometric properties to guide isovalue selection, but did not discuss algorithms for contour tree layout...
Bajaj et al. [1] introduced the contour spectrum which represents several measures for describing isosurfaces and a user interface for interactively setting parameters for the isovalue definition
...A number of user interface (UI) mechanisms have been proposed, including the contour spectrum [1], which reduces classification to handling a series of curves, transfer function widgets [14] and user painting [32]...
Bajaj et al. (1997) introduced the use of the contour spectrum and the contour tree, which captures the topological relationships between all possible isosurfaces
