Unification-based grammar formalisms use structures containing sets of features to describe linguistic objects
Although computational algorithms for unification of feature structures have been worked out in experimental research, these algorithms become quite complicated, and a more precise description of feature structures is desirable
We have developed a model in which descriptions of feature structures can be regarded as logical formulas, and interpreted by sets of directed graphs which satisfy them
This semantics for feature structures extends the ideas of Pereira and Shieber [11], by providing an interpretation for values which are specified by disjunctions and path values embedded within disjunctions
Our interpretation differs from that of Pereira and Shieber by using a logical model in place of a denotational semantics
In the context of computational linguistics, one commonly used [5] logic for feature trees is the propositional modal logic that, in the context of feature structures (not n ecessarily trees), is also often supplemented with path-equivalence [50], as well as regular expressions [34]
There have been several proposal for a formal specication of feature structures, one of the most influential being [KR86], where the semantics of feature descriptions, possibly consisting of atoms, features, conjunction, disjunction, and path equivalences is dened relative to the domain of feature structures, which are labeled graphs
Semantic networks continued to evolve as a representation formalism (Lehmann 1992) and formed the basis of attribute value formalisms, such as feature structures (Kasper & Rounds 1986; Carpenter 1992), Ïˆ-types (Ait-Kaci 1984), and terminological subsumption languages (Brachman & Schmolze 1985)
There is a natural interpretation of feature structure descriptions as terms over a language with variables [35], as finite-state automata [24], or as rooted directed acyclic graphs, in which arcs are marked with labels and nodes correspond to values which are themselves directed acyclic graphs [33]
Disjunction has been shown to be the source of NPcompleteness for the consistency problem of feature structure descriptions [24]
The structures that terms denote are the finite state automata (actually equivalence classes containing such automata; for details, we refer to Moshier [1988] for a discussion about these structures) as defined by Kasper and Rounds (1986) and used in defining the satisfiability of formulae in their logic
Following Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), Pereira and Shieber (1984), Kasper and Rounds (1986, 1990), and Johnson (1988, 1990a) the constraints that determine the feature structures are regarded as formulae from a language for describing feature structures, rather than as feature structures themselves
The most widely known model of feature structures and constraint language is the one developed to explain disjunctive feature values by Kasper and Rounds (1986, 1990) and Kasper (1986, 1987)
In particular, it builds on the logic of Kasper and Rounds [3], a logic intended specifically to describe feature structures
