We develop a method for predicting query performance by computing the relative entropy between a query language model and the corresponding collection language model
The resulting clarity score measures the coherence of the language usage in documents whose models are likely to generate the query
In particular, we compare the automatic thresholds to optimum thresholds and also check how frequently results as good are achieved in sampling experiments that randomly assign queries to the two classes
In the field of IR, the predicted query difficulty was found to correlate strongly with the average precision (AP) [9]
(2002) to determine the threshold for a clarity score metric measuring the performance of queries in general IR searches
The prediction methods documented in the literature use a variety of available data as a basis for prediction, such as a query, its properties with respect to the retrieval space [7], the output of the retrieval system [5], or the output of other systems [3]
Term clarity [10] is a characteristic of the term itself, and initially we thought that it would correlate well with necessity
Clarity Score [8] is based on the intuition that the top m ranked documents of an unambiguous query will be topically cohesive and terms particular to the topic will appear with high frequency
The uncommon, nonspecific and sometimes ambiguous queries always lead to non-relevant and even puzzling results [2], [3]
Thus, queries that reflect the user¡¯s topical intention perform well to retrieve topical relevant and high-quality documents [2]
These include predicting the quality (or performance) of queries using either pre-retrieval indicators like Query Scope [10], or post-retrieval indicators like Query Clarity [7]
Previously, divergence has been used to measure how strongly a subset of documents is distinguished from a collection, and has been applied to the task of query difficulty prediction [5]
Measures such as query clarity [6], Jensen-Shannon divergence [4], and weighted information gain [23] have been developed to predict performance on a query (as measured by average precision, for example)
The clarity prediction paradigm [4] is based on measuring the ¡°focus¡± (clarity) of the result-list with respect to the corpus by computing different forms of their ¡°distance¡± [5,6,7]
[6] showed that query performance can be predicted using the relative entropy between a query language model and the corresponding collection language model as a clarity score
