We develop a method for predicting query performance by computing the relative entropy between a query language model and the corresponding collection language model
The resulting clarity score measures the coherence of the language usage in documents whose models are likely to generate the query
We suggest that clarity scores measure the ambiguity of a query with respect to a collection of documents and show that they correlate positively with average precision in a variety of TREC test sets
Thus, the clarity score may be used to identify ineffective queries, on average, without relevance information
We develop an algorithm for automatically setting the clarity score threshold between predicted poorly-performing queries and acceptable queries and validate it using TREC data
In particular, we compare the automatic thresholds to optimum thresholds and also check how frequently results as good are achieved in sampling experiments that randomly assign queries to the two classes
In the field of IR, the predicted query difficulty was found to correlate strongly with the average precision (AP) [9]
(2002) propose to predict query performance by computing the relative entropy (clarity score) between a query language model and the corresponding collection language model (static prediction)
These include predicting the quality (or performance) of queries using either pre-retrieval indicators like Query Scope [10], or post-retrieval indicators like Query Clarity [7]
This column contains the values of some popular query quality predictors for each of the sub-queries: Query Clarity [7], average inverse collection term frequency (AvICTF) [10], average inverse document frequency (AvIDF), and query scope (QS) [10]
Research making use of estimates of the number of topics present in a group of documents has been carried out in association with query performance prediction [7,8]
A clarity score has been proposed [6] to measure the coherence of a list of retrieved documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model
One signiflcant contribution in query performance prediction is clarity score [1]
On the other hand, postretrieval predictors such as Query Clarity[3] base their predictions on the ranked list of results, which provides more information to the predictor, making accurate predictions easier to achieve
For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model
