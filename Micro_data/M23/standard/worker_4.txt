We develop a method for predicting query performance by computing the relative entropy between a query language model and the corresponding collection language model
The resulting clarity score measures the coherence of the language usage in documents whose models are likely to generate the query
We suggest that clarity scores measure the ambiguity of a query with respect to a collection of documents and show that they correlate positively with average precision in a variety of TREC test sets
Thus, the clarity score may be used to identify ineffective queries, on average, without relevance information
We develop an algorithm for automatically setting the clarity score threshold between predicted poorly-performing queries and acceptable queries and validate it using TREC data
In particular, we compare the automatic thresholds to optimum thresholds and also check how frequently results as good are achieved in sampling experiments that randomly assign queries to the two classes
It is inspired by the clarity score proposed for query performance prediction in adhoc information retrieval for textual documents [2]
Among such methods, we employ Query Clarity [6], which predicts performance using the KL divergence between a query language model and a collection language model
These include predicting the quality (or performance) of queries using either pre-retrieval indicators like Query Scope [10], or post-retrieval indicators like Query Clarity [7]
Various methods, such as Clarity score [2], have been proposed for query difficulty prediction
Cronen-Townsend suggest that query performance is correlated with the clarity of a query [8]
[5] computed the query clarity score by measuring the information-theoretic distance between the query language model and the collection language model, and showed that clarity scores are correlated with query difficulty
[2] extended the clarity score approach [5] to a more comprehensive distance measure which includes the pairwise information-theoretic distances between distributions associated with the collection, the set of relevant documents, and the query
Such query models are also useful for identifying structure and context within the query [6], estimating the difficultly of the query for performance prediction [8], automatically completing queries by predicting subsequent terms [3], and automatic query expansion[5]
In contrast, here we assume that the divergence is correlated with the performance of using the expansion model itself
