We develop a method for predicting query performance by computing the relative entropy between a query language model and the corresponding collection language model
The resulting clarity score measures the coherence of the language usage in documents whose models are likely to generate the query
We suggest that clarity scores measure the ambiguity of a query with respect to a collection of documents and show that they correlate positively with average precision in a variety of TREC test sets
Thus, the clarity score may be used to identify ineffective queries, on average, without relevance information
We develop an algorithm for automatically setting the clarity score threshold between predicted poorly-performing queries and acceptable queries and validate it using TREC data
It is inspired by the clarity score proposed for query performance prediction in adhoc information retrieval for textual documents [2]
Query performance prediction is to predict the effectiveness of a keyword query in retrieving relevance documents from a document collection [2]
Averaged Inverse Document Frequency (AvIDF) [18] assumes the more discriminative the query terms on average, the better the query will perform
[7] this postretrieval predictor is the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the query model from the collection model
Query clarity score is proposed in [4] to evaluate the topical cohesiveness among the documents matching a given query and its effectiveness was well supported by the experiments
Measures such as clarity [4], Jensen-Shannon divergence [1], and weighted information gain [26] have been developed to predict the performance on a query (as measured by average precision or mean reciprocal rank, for example) using characteristics of the query and/or result sets
[5] computed the query clarity score by measuring the information-theoretic distance between the query language model and the collection language model, and showed that clarity scores are correlated with query difficulty
[2] extended the clarity score approach [5] to a more comprehensive distance measure which includes the pairwise information-theoretic distances between distributions associated with the collection, the set of relevant documents, and the query
[1] proposed to use the relative entropy between a query and the collection to quantify query clarity, but the score is not easily aligned to concepts in human¡¯s mind
One of these is through determining the query clarity, which is a way of quantifying the possible ambiguity in a query [1, 3, 7]
