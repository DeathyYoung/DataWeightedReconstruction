...The prediction methods documented in the literature use a variety of available data as a basis for prediction, such as a query, its properties with respect to the retrieval space [7], the output of the retrieval system [5], or the output of other systems [3]......More effective predictors have been defined on formal probabilistic grounds based on language models by the so-called clarity score, which captures the (lack of) ambiguity in a query with respect to the collection, or a specific result set [7,23,24] (the second case thus falling in the category of post-retrieval prediction)......In its original formulation [7], query clarity is defined as follows:......with w being any term, q the query, d a document or its model, R the set of documents in the collection that contain at least one query term (it is also possible to take the whole collection here), pml(w|d) the relative frequency of term w in document d, pc(w) the relative frequency of the term in the collection as a whole, Œª a free parameter (set to 0.6 in [7]), and V the entire vocabulary......Now, inspired by the clarity score defined for query performance [7], we consider its adaptation to predict neighbor performance in collaborative recommendation......Cronen-Townsend et al showed that clarity is correlated with performance, because the less ambiguous a query, the more chances are that the system will return a good result in response [7]......In the computation of clarity values, the Œª1 and Œª2 parameters were set to 0.6, as in [7]......While being indicative of a positive trend, and not far from previous results in query performance [5], observed correlation values still leave room for further elaboration and refinements of the proposed predictor and alternative ones, as well as the NG metric itself, in order to match the best findings in query performance [7]...
