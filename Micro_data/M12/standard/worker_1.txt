The Scatter/Gather document browsing method uses fast document clustering to produce table-of-contents-like outlines of large document collections
Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections
However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection
This involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy
Many researchers have attempted to employ the techniques of traditional text/document clustering (referred as long text clustering) [4,10,13,35,46,47] to reorganize search results, and then use cluster labeling method [7,9,36,37] to assign a readable label to each cluster
This system divides a document corpus into groups and allows users to iteratively examine the resultant document groups or sub-groups for content navigation
The Scatter/Gatherer system by Cutting et al [3, 4, 6] utilizes the Buckshot and Fractionation algorithms to define document cluster centers, given Figure 1
Each item in the focus set represents one or many documents and contains their most relevant features (in [2], the term frequencies of the most frequent terms, the number of documents represented, and some example documents)
Clustering a set of points into a few groups is frequently used for statistical analysis and classification in numerous applications, including information retrieval [10], [11], [12], [31], facility location [15], [34], data mining [2], [33], spatial data bases [13], [25], [30], data compression [28], image processing [24], [32], astrophysics [27], and scientific computing [9]
Unsupervised clustering problem has been addressed in the context of many disciplines, including pattern recognition, artiflcial intelligence, information retrievalanddatamining
Hearst and Pedersen [HP961 m-examine the cluster hypothesis by focusing on the Scatter/Gather system [CKP93] and conclude that it holds for browsing tasks
Systems like Scatter/Gather [CKP93] provide a mechanism for user-driven organization of data into a fixed number of clusters, but user feedback is required and the computed clusters do not have accuracy guarantees
In particular, it would be very interesting to see how to combine our fixedneighborhood search with the ideas of scatter/gather [16]
Also, our approach of computing context-dependent document signatures to aid search and browsing appears to be a new extension to the scattergather type of retrieval interface [12]
One of the best clustering methods is the Scatter/Gather browsing paradigm [2,3,6] which clusters documents into topically-coherent groups
