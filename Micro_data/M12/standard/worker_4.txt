The Scatter/Gather document browsing method uses fast document clustering to produce table-of-contents-like outlines of large document collections
Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections
However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection
This involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy
Many researchers have attempted to employ the techniques of traditional text/document clustering (referred as long text clustering) [4,10,13,35,46,47] to reorganize search results, and then use cluster labeling method [7,9,36,37] to assign a readable label to each cluster
This system divides a document corpus into groups and allows users to iteratively examine the resultant document groups or sub-groups for content navigation
Research also investigated a method that used a precomputed hierarchy of meta-documents for further expansion of selected items and reclustering of the subset [5]
Although some researchers observed that approaches of this kind were too restrictive and could serve only one cluster at each presentation [5], this is not necessarily the case, as described in Section 2
Pirolli and Card (1999) presented the classical patch model from optimal foraging theory and showed its application to user behavior in browsing a document clustering system called Scatter/Gather (Cutting, Karger, & Pedersen, 1993; Cutting, Karger, Pedersen, & Tukey, 1992)
The Scatter/Gatherer system by Cutting et al [3, 4, 6] utilizes the Buckshot and Fractionation algorithms to define document cluster centers, given Figure 1
[3][6][11][10]) apply traditional clustering algorithms which first cluster documents into topically-coherent groups according to content similarity, and generate descriptive summaries for clusters
Unsupervised clustering problem has been addressed in the context of many disciplines, including pattern recognition, artiflcial intelligence, information retrievalanddatamining
Even constant-time clustering algorithms such as constant-time Scatter/Gather [7] can, because of large constants, be too slow for very large data sets
Research also investigated a method that used a precomputed hierarchy of meta-documents for further expansion of selected items and reclustering of the subset [5]
Whereas the method in [5] focused on coarse-grained patterns of local subsets by reclustering meta-documents, our approach maintains a global view of the local ones and reasonably skips local reclustering
