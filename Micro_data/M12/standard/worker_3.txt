The Scatter/Gather document browsing method uses fast document clustering to produce table-of-contents-like outlines of large document collections
Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections
However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection
Many researchers have attempted to employ the techniques of traditional text/document clustering (referred as long text clustering) [4,10,13,35,46,47] to reorganize search results, and then use cluster labeling method [7,9,36,37] to assign a readable label to each cluster
Whereas the method in [5] focused on coarse-grained patterns of local subsets by reclustering meta-documents, our approach maintains a global view of the local ones and reasonably skips local reclustering
Their early work had proposed using scatter/gatther as a tool for browsing large to very large document collections [9, 8], wherein the focus was placed on the e©\ciency of clustering: a linear time algorithm [9] and a constant interaction-time algorithm [8] were proposed respectively for clustering documents in the scatter process
Apart from the set of the cluster¡¯s frequent terms [8] and the relevant news titles [9], these systems do not offer any further information about the events that the generated clusters are representing
Recently, document clustering has been put forward as an important tool for Web search engines [15] [16] [18] [30], navigating and browsing document collections [5] [6] [8] [9] [23] and distributed retrieval [29]
In practice, simpler methods such as truncating the document or cluster centroid vectors to retain only the most frequent terms (i
One of the best clustering methods is the Scatter/Gather browsing paradigm [2,3,6] which clusters documents into topically-coherent groups
Systems like Scatter/Gather [CKP93] provide a mechanism for user-driven organization of data in a fixed number of clusters, but the users need to be in the loop and the computed clusters do not have accuracy guarantees
A dynamic programming analysis of information foraging is presented for a browser that clusters large-scale text collections, called Scatter/Gather (Cutting, Karger, & Pedersen, 1993; Cutting, Karger, Pedersen, & Tukey, 1992; Pirolli, Schank, Hearst, & Diehl, 1996) The interaction space of the baseline model is based on empirical data (Pirolli & Card, 1995; Pirolli et al
In particular, it would be very interesting to see how to combine our fixedneighborhood search with the ideas of scatter/gather [15], or an automatic classificationsystem like AIM [16]
To address this situation, we have developed a browsing paradigm, called Scatter/Gather [3, 4], which allows a user to rapidly assess the general contents of a very large collection by scanning through a hierarchical representation that acts as a dynamic table of con-
We have adapted the Xerox PARC scatter/gather clustering algorithm [8, 9] to support dynamic, incremental formation of information clusters and graph animation presentation mechanisms for rendering inter-cluster relationships
