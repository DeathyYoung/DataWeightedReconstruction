The Scatter/Gather document browsing method uses fast document clustering to produce table-of-contents-like outlines of large document collections
Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections
However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection
Many researchers have attempted to employ the techniques of traditional text/document clustering (referred as long text clustering) [4,10,13,35,46,47] to reorganize search results, and then use cluster labeling method [7,9,36,37] to assign a readable label to each cluster
This system divides a document corpus into groups and allows users to iteratively examine the resultant document groups or sub-groups for content navigation
Their early work had proposed using scatter/gatther as a tool for browsing large to very large document collections [9, 8], wherein the focus was placed on the e©\ciency of clustering: a linear time algorithm [9] and a constant interaction-time algorithm [8] were proposed respectively for clustering documents in the scatter process
The Scatter/Gatherer system by Cutting et al [3, 4, 6] utilizes the Buckshot and Fractionation algorithms to define document cluster centers, given Figure 1
We tried two different weighting schemes for the term vectors for the documents and cluster profiles, the term frequency as in [3, 2], and BM25 weights (a variant of tf¡¤idf [10] which is also used for resource selection in Pepper)
[3][6][11][10]) apply traditional clustering algorithms which first cluster documents into topically-coherent groups according to content similarity, and generate descriptive summaries for clusters
Also, our approach of computing context-dependent document signatures to aid search and browsing appears to be a new extension to the scattergather type of retrieval interface [12]
Hearst and Pedersen [HP96] re-examine the cluster hypothesis by focusing on the Scatter/Gather system [CKP93] and conclude that it holds for browsing tasks
For example, the user might send the contents of the a TileBar window to an interface like Scatter/Gather [7] which can cluster the document subset, and display their main topics
Another interactive approach, Scatter/Gather [3, 2], lets the user navigate through the re trieved results and dynamically clusters based on this navigation
Pirolli and Card (1999) presented the classical patch model from optimal foraging theory and showed its application to user behavior in browsing a document clustering system called Scatter/Gather (Cutting, Karger, & Pedersen, 1993; Cutting, Karger, Pedersen, & Tukey, 1992)
Cutting & Karger used term frequency as the weight of word and select words with high weight as clustering description [4] [5]
