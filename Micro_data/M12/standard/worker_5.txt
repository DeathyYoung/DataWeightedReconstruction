The Scatter/Gather document browsing method uses fast document clustering to produce table-of-contents-like outlines of large document collections
Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections
However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection
Many researchers have attempted to employ the techniques of traditional text/document clustering (referred as long text clustering) [4,10,13,35,46,47] to reorganize search results, and then use cluster labeling method [7,9,36,37] to assign a readable label to each cluster
1 The seminal research work in information retrieval uses scatter/gather as a tool for browsing large to very large document collections [6, 7]
Research also investigated a method that used a precomputed hierarchy of meta-documents for further expansion of selected items and reclustering of the subset [5]
Whereas the method in [5] focused on coarse-grained patterns of local subsets by reclustering meta-documents, our approach maintains a global view of the local ones and reasonably skips local reclustering
Each item in the focus set represents one or many documents and contains their most relevant features (in [2], the term frequencies of the most frequent terms, the number of documents represented, and some example documents)
Many document clustering algorithms rely on off-line clustering of the entire collection [13,2], but on the web the collection is too large and fluid to allow an off-line approach
Systems like Scatter/Gather [CKP93] provide a mechanism for user-driven organization of data in a xed number of clusters, but the users need to be in the loop and the computed clusters do not have accuracy guarantees
One of the best clustering methods is the Scatter/Gather browsing paradigm [CDRKT92,CKP93,HP96] that clusters documents into topically-coherent groups
To scale it up to large collections, a variety of sampling techniques exist [20]
[CCFM97] consider a dynamic clustering algorithm to partition a collection of text documents into a fixed number of clusters
Cutting, Karger, and Pedersen (1993) proposed an algorithm that used a precomputed hierarchy of meta-documents for further expansion of selected items and reclustering of the subset
The Scatter/Gather system [16, 17] uses the clustering of documents as the basis of a browser suitable for large numbers of documents
