Title:Constant interaction-time scatter/gather browsing of very large document collections		Conference:Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR		Author:Douglass R. Cuttingl;David R. Karger;Jan O. Pedersen
The Scatter/Gather document browsing method uses fast document clustering to produce table-of-contents-like outlines of large document collections. Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections. However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection. We present a scheme that supports constant interaction-time Scatter/Gather of arbitrarily large collections after near-linear time preprocessing. This involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy. A modification of Scatter/Gather employing this scheme, and an example of its use over the Tipster collection are presented.

...Research also investigated a method that used a precomputed hierarchy of meta-documents for further expansion of selected items and reclustering of the subset [5]......In Section 2.1, we elaborate on the proposed LAIR2 algorithm, which takes advantage of a precomputed hierarchy but, different from [5], does not rely on meta-documents for reclustering......The LAIR2 method looks similar to another algorithm that used precomputed hierarchical meta-documents [5]......Although some researchers observed that approaches of this kind were too restrictive and could serve only one cluster at each presentation [5], this is not necessarily the case, as described in Section 2.1......Whereas the method in [5] focused on coarse-grained patterns of local subsets by reclustering meta-documents, our approach maintains a global view of the local ones and reasonably skips local reclustering......Previous research on Scatter/Gather underestimated the flexibility of using a pure hierarchy for reclustering and chose to follow more complicated directions [5]...
