Title:Composing Real-Time Systems		Conference:International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence - IJCAI		Author:Stuart J. Russell;Shlomo Zilberstein
We present a method to construct real-time systems using as components anytime algo- rithms whose quality of results degrades grace¬≠ fully as computation time decreases. Introduc¬≠ ing computation time as a degree of freedom defines a scheduling problem involving the ac¬≠ tivation and interruption of the anytime com¬≠ ponents. This scheduling problem is especially complicated when trying to construct inter- ruptible algorithms, whose total run-time is un¬≠ known in advance. We introduce a framework to measure the performance of anytime algo¬≠ rithms and solve the problem of constructing interruptible algorithms by a mathematical re¬≠ duction to the problem of constructing con¬≠ tract algorithms, which require the determi¬≠ nation of the total run-time when activated. We show how the composition of anytime algo¬≠ rithms can be mechanized as part of a compiler for a LISP-like programming language for real- time systems. The result is a new approach to the construction of complex real-time sys¬≠ tems that separates the arrangement of the per¬≠ formance components from the optimization of their scheduling, and automates the latter task.
