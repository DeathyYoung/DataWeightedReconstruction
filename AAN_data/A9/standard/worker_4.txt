D-2: The extracted phrasal paraphrases (including self-paraphrases) are stored in a phrase table, in which each phrase pair has 4 scores measuring their alignment confidence (Koehn et al
, 2003) start-out from a wordaligned parallel corpus working with (in principle) arbitrarily large phrase pairs (also called blocks) acquired from word-aligned parallel data under a simple definition of translational equivalence (Zens et al
, 2003) translate sentences by maximising the translation probability as defined by the log-linear combination of a number of feature functions, whose weights are chosen to opti457 mise translation quality (Och, 2003)
Phrase pairs are extracted up to a fixed maximum length, since very long phrases rarely have a tangible impact during translation (Koehn et al
2 SMT and TM systems We use a standard log-linear PB-SMT model (Och and Ney, 2002): GIZA++ implementation of IBM word alignment model 4, the phrase-extraction heuristics described in (Koehn et al
, 2003), minimum-error-rate training (Och, 2003), a 5-gram language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing trained with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) on the English side of the training data, and Moses (Koehn et al
The corresponding foreign phrase (festgenommen) is identified using word alignment and phrase extraction techniques from phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al
Practitioners of both phrasebased and syntax-based SMT have reported severe grammar coverage issues when rules are required to exactly match parse constituents (Koehn et al
One popular approach arguably the most successful so far is Statistical Phrase-based Machine Translation (PBMT), which learns phrase translation rules from aligned bilingual text corpora (Och et al
The lowercased and tokenized training data was then filtered for length and aligned using the GIZA++ implementation of IBM Model 4 (Och and Ney, 2003) to obtain one-to-many alignments in both directions and symmetrized by combining both into a single alignment using the grow-diagfinal-and method (Koehn et al
2 Architecture of the system The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is to produce a target sentence e from a source sentence f
To generate phrase pairs from a parallel corpus, we use the "diag-and" phrase induction algorithm described in (Koehn et al, 2003), with symmetrized word alignments generated using IBM model 2 (Brown et al, 1993)
However, attempts to retrofit syntactic information into the phrase-based paradigm have not met with enormous success (Koehn et al
As for the SMT system, we use a standard log-linear PB-SMT model (Och and Ney, 2002): GIZA++ implementation of IBM word alignment model 4,1 the refinement and phraseextraction heuristics described in (Koehn et al
We ran GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) on the training corpus in both directions with IBM model 4, and then applied the refinement rule described in (Koehn et al
