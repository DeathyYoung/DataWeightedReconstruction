Our decoder is a phrase-based multi-stack imple5 mentation of the log-linear model similar to Pharaoh (Koehn et al
Recently, Cabezas and Resnik (2005) experimented with incorporating WSD translations into Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based MT system (Koehn et al
4 Experiments Phrase-based SMT systems have been shown to outperform word-based approaches (Koehn et al
Our method for identifying paraphrases is an extension of recent work in phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al
2 From the word-to-word alignments, the system extracts a phrase table (Koehn et al
The phrase-based decoder extracts phrases from the word alignments produced by GIZA++, and computes translation probabilities based on the frequency of one phrase being aligned with another (Koehn et al
Each model can represent an important feature for the translation, such as phrase-based, language, or lexical models (Koehn et al
The transcription probabilities can then be easily learnt from the alignments induced by GIZA++, using a scoring function (Koehn et al
We propose a new phrase-based translationmodel and decoding algorithm that enablesus to evaluate and compare several, previ-ously proposed phrase-based translation mod-els
Surpris-ingly, learning phrases longer than three wordsand learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strongimpact on performance
Within our framework, we carry out alarge number of experiments to understand bet-ter and explain why phrase-based models out-perform word-based models
Our empirical re-sults, which hold for all examined languagepairs, suggest that the highest levels of perfor-mance can be obtained through relatively sim-ple means: heuristic learning of phrase trans-lations from word-based alignments and lexi-cal weighting of phrase translations
However, reordering models in traditional phrase-based systems are not sufficient to treat such complex cases when we translate long sentences (Koehn et al, 2003)
Such a quasi-syntactic structure can naturally capture the reordering of phrases that is not directly modeled by a conventional phrase-based approach (Koehn et al
1 Translation model The system developed for this years shared task is a state-of-the-art, two-pass phrase-based statistical machine translation system based on a log-linear translation model (Koehn et al, 2003)
