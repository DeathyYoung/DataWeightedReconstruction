The core of our engine is the dynamic programming algorithm for monotone phrasal decoding (Zens and Ney, 2004)
Our approach to phrase-table smoothing contrasts to previous work (Zens and Ney, 2004) in which smoothed phrase probabilities are constructed from word-pair probabilities and combined in a log-linear model with an unsmoothed phrase-table
Above the phrase level, these models typically have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al
1 Introduction Todays statistical machine translation systems rely on high quality phrase translation pairs to acquire state-of-the-art performance, see (Koehn et al
2004), hereafter ATS, and the IBM phrase-based system (Tillmann 2004; Tillmann and Zhang 2005), have phrase-reordering models that add some lexical sensitivity
The log-linear model is also based on standard features: conditional probabilities and lexical smoothing of phrases in both directions, and phrase penalty (Zens and Ney, 2004)
We use a phrase-based translation approach as described in (Zens and Ney, 2004)
Yet this approach loses the advantage of context-sensitive lexical selection: the word translation model depends only on the word classes to subcategorize for translations, which leads to less accurate lexical choice in practice (Zens & Ney, 2004)
For tractability, we followed standard practice with this technique and considered only monotonic alignments when decoding (Zens and Ney, 2004)
The following methods were investigated: (Monotone) Phrase-based MT on character level: A state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system (Zens and Ney, 2004) was used for name transliteration, i
In (Zens and Ney, 2004) the downhill simplex method is used to estimate the weights; around 200 iterations are required for convergence to occur
The translation results forthe Xerox and Canadian Hansards task are verypromising
In statistical machine translation, the currentlybest performing systems are based in some wayon phrases or word groups
2 Review of phrase-based translation system For the confidence measures which will be introduced in section 5, we use a state-of-the-art phrasebased approach as described in (Zens and Ney, 2004)
4 Decoder Our decoder builds upon machine translations monotone phrasal decoding (Zens and Ney, 2004), or equivalently, the sequence tagging algorithm used in semi-Markov CRFs (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004)
