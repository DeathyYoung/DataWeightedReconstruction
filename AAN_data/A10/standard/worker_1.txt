Our MT system uses a phrase-based decoder and the log-linear model described in (Zens and Ney, 2004)
Our approach to phrase-table smoothing contrasts to previous work (Zens and Ney, 2004) in which smoothed phrase probabilities are constructed from word-pair probabilities and combined in a log-linear model with an unsmoothed phrase-table
We experimented with two levels of distortion: monotonic, where the phrasal alignment is monotonic (but word reordering is still possible within a phrase) and limited distortion, where only adjacent phrases are allowed to exchange positions (Zens and Ney, 2004)
Above the phrase level, some models perform no reordering (Zens and Ney 2004; Kumar, Deng, and Byrne 2006), some have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Och and Ney 2004), and some, for example, the Alignment Template System (Och et al
Therefore, we search for the best pronunciation over all segmentations of the word, adapting the monotone search algorithm proposed by Zens and Ney (2004) for phrase-based machine translation
The following methods were investigated: (Monotone) Phrase-based MT on character level: A state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system (Zens and Ney, 2004) was used for name transliteration, i
The log-linear model is also based on standard features: conditional probabilities and lexical smoothing of phrases in both directions, and phrase penalty (Zens and Ney, 2004)
Yet this approach loses the advantage of context-sensitive lexical selection: the word translation model depends only on the word classes to subcategorize for translations, which leads to less accurate lexical choice in practice (Zens & Ney, 2004)
3 Document and Name Translation We use a statistical, phrase-based MT system (Zens and Ney, 2004) to translate Chinese documents into English for Type A Approaches
For tractability, we followed standard practice with this technique and considered only monotonic alignments when decoding (Zens and Ney, 2004)
Each includes relative frequency estimates and lexical estimates (based on Zens and Ney, 2004) of forward and backward conditional probabilities
In order to complete the conversion from a pipeline approach to a joint approach, we fold our input segmentation step into the exact search framework by replacing a separate segmentation module (#2) with a monotone phrasal decoder (Zens and Ney, 2004)
We describe a highly ef-ficient monotone search algorithm with a com-plexity linear in the input sentence length
2 Review of the Phrase-Based Translation System For the confidence measures which will be introduced in Section 5
1 Introduction Todays statistical machine translation systems rely on high quality phrase translation pairs to acquire state-of-the-art performance, see (Koehn et al
