In statistical machine translation, the currentlybest performing systems are based in some wayon phrases or word groups. We describe thebaseline phrase-based translation system andvarious refinements. We describe a highly ef-ficient monotone search algorithm with a com-plexity linear in the input sentence length. Wepresent translation results for three tasks: Verb-mobil, Xerox and the Canadian Hansards. Forthe Xerox task, it takes less than 7 seconds totranslate the whole test set consisting of morethan 10K words. The translation results forthe Xerox and Canadian Hansards task are verypromising. The system even outperforms thealignment template system.

1 Introduction Todays statistical machine translation systems rely on high quality phrase translation pairs to acquire state-of-the-art performance, see (Koehn et al. , 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004; Och and Ney, 2003).

2.2 Review of phrase-based translation system For the confidence measures which will be introduced in section 5, we use a state-of-the-art phrasebased approach as described in (Zens and Ney, 2004). (self citation)

Title:H05-1096		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Ueffing, Nicola; Ney, Hermann
Nowadays, most of the state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases (Bertoldi et al. , 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Tillmann, 2003; Vogel et al. , 2004; Zens and Ney, 2004). (self citation)

Title:P05-1033		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Chiang, David
Above the phrase level, these models typically have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003), or not at all (Zens and Ney, 2004; Kumar et al. , 2005).

Title:W06-1607		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Foster, George; Kuhn, Roland; Johnson, Howard
(Zens and Ney, 2004) obtain p(sj|ti) from smoothed relative-frequency estimates in a wordaligned corpus.

Title:W06-1607		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Foster, George; Kuhn, Roland; Johnson, Howard
(Zens and Ney, 2004) describe a noisy-or combination: p(sj|t) = 1p(sj|t) 1 Iproductdisplay i=1 (1p(sj|ti)) where sj is the probability that sj is not in the translation of t, and p(sj|ti) is a lexical probability.

Title:W06-1607		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Foster, George; Kuhn, Roland; Johnson, Howard
This is the traditional approach for glass-box smoothing (Koehn et al. , 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004).

Title:W06-3110		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Zens, Richard; Ney, Hermann
We use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system as described in (Zens and Ney, 2004; Zens et al. , 2005). (self citation)

Title:P06-1122		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Talbot, David; Osborne, Miles
There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004).

We thus propose to adapt the statistical machine translation model (Brown et al. , 1993; Zens and Ney, 2004) for SMS text normalization.

We use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system (Zens and Ney, 2004; Zens et al. , 2005) including the following models: an n-gram language model, a phrase translation model and a word-based lexicon model. (self citation)

Title:P06-1096		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Liang, Percy; Bouchard-C&ocirc;t&eacute;, Alexandre; Klein, Dan; Taskar, Ben
We experimented with two levels of distortion: monotonic, where the phrasal alignment is monotonic (but word reordering is still possible within a phrase) and limited distortion, where only adjacent phrases are allowed to exchange positions (Zens and Ney, 2004).

Title:P06-1096		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Liang, Percy; Bouchard-C&ocirc;t&eacute;, Alexandre; Klein, Dan; Taskar, Ben
Finally, we use POS features to parameterize a distortion model in a limited distortion decoder (Zens and Ney, 2004; Tillmann and Zhang, 2005).

Title:W06-3118		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Johnson, Howard; Sadat, Fatiha; Foster, George; Kuhn, Roland; Simard, Michel; Joanis, Eric; Larkin, Samuel
Our approach to phrase-table smoothing contrasts to previous work (Zens and Ney, 2004) in which smoothed phrase probabilities are constructed from word-pair probabilities and combined in a log-linear model with an unsmoothed phrase-table.

Title:P07-1039		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Ma, Yanjun; Stroppa, Nicolas; Way, Andy
The log-linear model is also based on standard features: conditional probabilities and lexical smoothing of phrases in both directions, and phrase penalty (Zens and Ney, 2004).

Title:P07-1119		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Sherif, Tarek; Kondrak, Grzegorz
In particular, our methods are inspired by the monotone search algorithm proposed in (Zens and Ney, 2004).

The first is an adaptation of the monotone search algorithm outlined in (Zens and Ney, 2004).The second encodes the substringbased transliteration model as a transducer.

Title:W07-0717		Conference:Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Foster, George; Kuhn, Roland
For tractability, we followed standard practice with this technique and considered only monotonic alignments when decoding (Zens and Ney, 2004).

Title:W07-0717		Conference:Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Foster, George; Kuhn, Roland
We use two different estimates for the conditional probabilities p(?t|?s) and p(?s|?t): relative frequencies and ?lexical??probabilities as described in (Zens and Ney, 2004).

2.2 Review of the Phrase-Based Translation System For the confidence measures which will be introduced in Section 5.1, we use a stateof-the-art phrase-based translation approach as described in Zens and Ney (2004). (self citation)

Title:J07-1003		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Ueffing, Nicola; Ney, Hermann
Nowadays, most state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases (Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999; Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Tillmann 2003; Bertoldi et al. 2004; Vogel et al. 2004; Zens and Ney 2004; Chiang 2005). (self citation)

Title:P07-1020		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Bangalore, Srinivas; Haffner, Patrick; Kanthak, Stephan
For the Hansard corpus we used the same training and test split as in (Zens and Ney, 2004): 1.4 million training sentence pairs and 5432 test sentences.

Title:J07-2003		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Chiang, David
Above the phrase level, some models perform no reordering (Zens and Ney 2004; Kumar, Deng, and Byrne 2006), some have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Och and Ney 2004), and some, for example, the Alignment Template System (Och et al. 2004; Thayer et al. 2004), hereafter ATS, and the IBM phrase-based system (Tillmann 2004; Tillmann and Zhang 2005), have phrase-reordering models that add some lexical sensitivity.

Title:P07-1092		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Cohn, Trevor; Lapata, Mirella
This represents the translation probability of a phrase when it is decomposed into a series of independent word-for-word translation steps (Koehn et al. , 2003), and has proven a very effective feature (Zens and Ney, 2004; Foster et al. , 2006).

Title:W07-0701		Conference:Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Menezes, Arul; Quirk, Chris
Yet this approach loses the advantage of context-sensitive lexical selection: the word translation model depends only on the word classes to subcategorize for translations, which leads to less accurate lexical choice in practice (Zens & Ney, 2004).

For instance, it was suggested to use IBM-1 probabilities (Och et al. , 2004), or other lexical translation probabilities (Koehn et al. , 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004).

It is today common practice to use additional feature functions like IBM-1 scores to obtain some kind of smoothing (Och et al. , 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004), but better estimation of the phrase probabilities is usually not addressed.

The source text, annotated with name translations, is then passed to a statistical, phrase-based MT system (Zens and Ney, 2004).

For example, the best parse of the word gnat is g nat, which yields the pronunciation G N AE T, while the parse gn at would give the correct pronunciation N AE T. Therefore, we search for the best pronunciation over all segmentations of the word, adapting the monotone search algorithm proposed by Zens and Ney (2004) for phrase-based machine translation.3 4.2 Smoothing A bigram model is used over both the grapheme and phoneme subwords.
