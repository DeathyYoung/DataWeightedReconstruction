Thereby, the context of words is taken into account in the translation model, and local changesin word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly
The model is describedusing a log-linear modeling approach, which is a generalization of the often used source?channel
After word alignment, standard Moses phrase extraction tool (Och and Ney, 2004) is used to build the translation models and finally Moses (Koehn et
A popular statistical machine translation paradigms is the phrase-based model (Koehn et al
We extract paraphrasing verb expressions from a phrasal SMT translation table learnt from parallel corpora (Och and Ney, 2004)
Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems analyze large quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to learn translational alignments between pairs of words and phrases in two languages (Och and Ney, 2004)
2 The Problem of Coverage in SMT Statistical machine translation made considerable advances in translation quality with the introduction of phrase-based translation (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al
Given a sentence pair and its corresponding word-level alignment, phrases will be extracted by using the approach in (Och and Ney, 2004)
2 Phrase-based Extraction The Alignment Template system (ATS) described by Och and Ney (2004) is representative of statistical phrase-based models
 , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) are good at learning local translations that are pairs of (consecutive) sub-strings, but often insufficient in modeling the reorderings of phrases themselves, especially between language pairs with very different word-order
, 2006) have shown promising progress in improving translation quality, thanks to the incorporation of phrasal translation adopted from the widely used phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) to handle local fluency and the engagement of synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) to handle non-local phrase reordering
Following popular approaches to learning feature weights in the machine translation community (Och and Ney, 2004; Chiang, 2005), we use the minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) algorithm to learn the feature weights that directly optimize certain automatic evaluation metric
Phrase-based SMT(Statistical Machine Translation) models have advanced the state of the art in machine translation by expanding the basic unit of translation from words to phrases, which allows the local reordering of words and translation of multi-word expressions(Chiang, 2007) (Koehn et al
To cope with this problem, we propose a cascaded linear model inspired by the log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2004) widely used in statistical machine translation to incorporate different kinds of knowledge sources
The small amount of simplification data currently available has prevented the application of data-driven techniques like those used in other text-to-text translation areas (Och and Ney, 2004; Chiang, 2010)
