Examples of realistic systems are the phrase-based ATS system of Och and Ney (2004), the phrasal-syntax hybrid system Hiero (Chiang, 2005), and the GHKM syntax system (Galley et al
There have been considerable amount of efforts to improve the reordering model in SMT systems, ranging from the fundamental distance-based distortion model (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al
The use of word graphs in IMT has been studied in (Barrachina and others, 2008) in combination with two different translation techniques, namely, the Alignment Templates technique (Och et al
, 1990; Och and Ney, 2004) can be described as a mapping of a word sequence F in the source language to a word sequence E in the target language; this mapping is produced by the MT decoder (F)
 All phrase pairs in this paper are extracted with the phrase-extract algorithm (Och and Ney, 2004), with maximum length set to 7
Since the success of phrase-based methods (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn, 2004), models based on formal syntax (Chiang, 2005) or linguistic syntax (Liu et al
Phrase-based SMT(Statistical Machine Translation) models have advanced the state of the art in machine translation by expanding the basic unit of translation from words to phrases, which allows the local reordering of words and translation of multi-word expressions(Chiang, 2007) (Koehn et al
Thereby, the context of words is taken into account in the translation model, and local changesin word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly
Introduction The alignment template translation model (Och and Ney 2004) and related phrase-based models advanced the state of the art in machine translation by expanding the basic unit of translation from words to phrases, that is, substrings of potentially unlimited size (but not necessarily phrases in any syntactic theory)
The estimation of translation model parameters usually relies heavily on word-aligned corpora, not only for phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based models (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Och and Ney 2004; Chiang 2005, 2007), but also for syntax-based models (Quirk, Menezes, and Cherry 2005; Galley et al
1 Linear Models for SMT The job of a translation system is defined in Och and Ney (2004) as finding the English string e that is a translation of a foreign string f using a linear combination of feature functions h m (e, f) and weights m as follows: e = arg max e M summationdisplay m=1 m h m (e, f) As is now standard in SMT, several complex features such as lexical translation models and phrase translation models, trained in source-target and target-source directions, are combined with language models and simple features such as phrase and word counts
1 Baseline MT System: Alignment Templates Our baseline MT system is the alignment template system described in detail by Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999) and Och and Ney (2004)
Obviously, the NPA is a special case of the phrase extractor in (Och and Ney, 2004) in that it considers only one phrase alignment rather than all possible ones
To cope with this problem, we propose a cascaded linear model inspired by the log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2004) widely used in statistical machine translation to incorporate different kinds of knowledge sources
Translation is performed using a standard dynamic programming beam-search decoder (Och and Ney, 2004) using two decoding passes
