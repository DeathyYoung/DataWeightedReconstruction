Google RWTH AachenA phrase-based statistical machine translation approach ? the alignment template approach ? isdescribed. This translation approach allows for general many-to-many relations between words.Thereby, the context of words is taken into account in the translation model, and local changesin word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly. The model is describedusing a log-linear modeling approach, which is a generalization of the often used source?channel

Among these models, the basic ones are a translation model Pr(e|f) and a target language model Pr(e), which can be complemented by reordering models (if the language pairs presents very long alignments in training), word penalty to avoid favoring short sentences, class-based target-language models, etc (Och and Ney, 2004).

1 Introduction Phrase-based translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), which go beyond the original IBM translation models (Brown et al. , 1993) 1 by modeling translations of phrases rather than individual words, have been suggested to be the state-of-theart in statistical machine translation by empirical evaluations.

Most current SMT systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003) use a generative model for word alignment such as the freely available GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), an implementation of the IBM alignment models (Brown et al. , 1993).

Title:W06-3113		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Federico, Marcello; Bertoldi, Nicola
The current state of the art is represented by the so-called phrase-based translation approach (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003).

The phrase learning approach in (Och and Ney, 2004) takes two alignments: a source-to-target alignment a180 a10 and a target-to-source alignment a180 a178 . The intersection of these two alignments is computed to obtain a high-precision word alignment.

Title:W06-3602		Conference:Workshop On Computationally Hard Problems And Joint Inference In Speech And Language Processing		Author:Tillmann, Christoph
4 Efficient Block Alignment Algorithm A common approach to phrase-based SMT is to learn phrasal translation pairs from word-aligned training data (Och and Ney, 2004).

Title:N06-1001		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Wang, Wei; Knight, Kevin; Marcu, Daniel
Obviously, the NPA is a special case of the phrase extractor in (Och and Ney, 2004) in that it considers only one phrase alignment rather than all possible ones.

Title:N06-1001		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Wang, Wei; Knight, Kevin; Marcu, Daniel
An aligned phrase pair is consistent with the word alignment if neither phrase contains any word aligning to a word outside the other phrase (Och and Ney, 2004).

2 Previous Work It is helpful to compare this approach with recent efforts in statistical MT. Phrase-based models (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) are good at learning local translations that are pairs of (consecutive) sub-strings, but often insufficient in modeling the reorderings of phrases themselves, especially between language pairs with very different word-order.

Introduction The alignment template translation model (Och and Ney 2004) and related phrase-based models advanced the state of the art in machine translation by expanding the basic unit of translation from words to phrases, that is, substrings of potentially unlimited size (but not necessarily phrases in any syntactic theory).

First, we identify initial phrase pairs using the same criterion as most phrase-based systems (Och and Ney 2004), namely, there must be at least one word inside one phrase aligned to a word inside the other, but no word inside one phrase can be aligned to a word outside the other phrase.

Above the phrase level, some models perform no reordering (Zens and Ney 2004; Kumar, Deng, and Byrne 2006), some have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Och and Ney 2004), and some, for example, the Alignment Template System (Och et al. 2004; Thayer et al. 2004), hereafter ATS, and the IBM phrase-based system (Tillmann 2004; Tillmann and Zhang 2005), have phrase-reordering models that add some lexical sensitivity.

To perform translation, state-of-the-art MT systems use a statistical phrase-based approach (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) by treating phrases as the basic units of translation.

1 Introduction Recent efforts in statistical machine translation (MT) have seen promising improvements in output quality, especially the phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based models (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al. , 2006).

2.2 Adding a Language Model To integrate with a bigram language model, we can use the dynamic-programming algorithms of Och and Ney (2004) and Wu (1996) for phrase-based and SCFG-based systems, respectively, which we may think of as doing a finer-grained version of the deductions above.

For French/English translation we use a state of the art phrase-based MT system similar to (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003).

Title:D07-1038		Conference:2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL)		Author:May, Jonathan; Knight, Kevin
Examples of realistic systems are the phrase-based ATS system of Och and Ney (2004), the phrasal-syntax hybrid system Hiero (Chiang, 2005), and the GHKM syntax system (Galley et al. , 2004; Galley et al. , 2006).

The alignment template approach (Och & Ney, 2004) uses word classes rather than lexical items to model phrase translation.

Title:W07-0701		Conference:Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Menezes, Arul; Quirk, Chris
An early attempt at greater generality in a purely phrasal setting was the alignment template approach (Och & Ney 2004); newer approaches include formally syntactic (Chiang 2005), and linguistically syntactic approaches (Quirk et al. 2005), (Huang et al. 2006).

This assumes that the probability of fi is independent given e and a. pw(f|e) takes the highest pw(f|e,a) if there are multiple alignments a. This discussion, which is partly based on Section 4.1.2 of (Och and Ney, 2004), means that the lexical translation probability pw(f|e) is another probability estimated using the word translation probability w(f|e).

1 Introduction The recent advances in statistical machine translation have been achieved by discriminatively training a small number of real-valued features based either on (hierarchical) phrase-based translation (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003; Chiang, 2005) or syntax-based translation (Galley et al. , 2006).

Approaches include word substitution systems (Brown et al. , 1993), phrase substitution systems (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), and synchronous context-free grammar systems (Wu and Wong, 1998; Chiang, 2005), all of which train on string pairs and seek to establish connections between source and target strings.

The TALP-UPC 2008 translation system, besides the bilingual translation model, which consists of a 4-gram LM of tuples with Kneser-Ney discounting (estimated with SRI Language Modeling Toolkit1), implements a log-linear combination of five additional feature models: a target language model (a 4-gram model of words, estimated with Kneser-Ney smoothing); a POS target language model (a 4-gram model of tags with Good-Turing discounting (TPOS)); a word bonus model, which is used to compensate the systems preference for short output sentences; a source-to-target lexicon model and a target-tosource lexicon model, these models use word-toword IBM Model 1 probabilities (Och and Ney, 2004) to estimate the lexical weights for each tuple in the translation table.

The rules we extract belong to one of the following categories: contains only words, and lscript is NULL; this corresponds to the general blocks used in phrasebased decoder (Och and Ney, 2004); contains words and variables of [X,0] and [X,1], and lscript is NULL; this corresponds to the Hiero rules as in Chiang (2005); contains words and variables in the form of [X,TAG2], in which TAG is from the LDC tagset; this defines a well formed subtree, in which at least one child (constituent) is aligned to continuous target ngrams.

Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 10598 ctill@us.ibm.com Abstract The paper presents an extension of a dynamic programming (DP) decoder for phrase-based SMT (Koehn, 2004; Och and Ney, 2004) that tightly integrates POS-based re-order rules (Crego and Marino, 2006) into a left-to-right beam-search algorithm, rather than handling them in a pre-processing or re-order graph generation step.

Forthebaselineapproach, onlythetranslation model and n-gram model for the target language are used: S = argmax S Pr(T|S) = argmax S Pr(S)Pr(S|T) Since the n-gram model tends to favor short translations, a penalty is added to the translation templates with fewer RHS symbols than LHS leaf symbols: Penalty(t) = exp(|t.RHS||t.LHSLeaf|) where |t.RHS| denotes the number of symbols in the RHS of t, and |t.LHSLeaf| denotes the number of leaves in the LHS of t. The length penalty is analogous to the length feature widely used in loglinear models for MT (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Och and Ney, 2004).

There are two major elements accounting for such an improvement: namely the incorporation of phrasal translation structures adopted from widely applied phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) to handle local uency, and the engagement of synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG), which enhances the generative capacity of the underlying model that is limited by nite-state machinery.

Phrase-based SMT(Statistical Machine Translation) models have advanced the state of the art in machine translation by expanding the basic unit of translation from words to phrases, which allows the local reordering of words and translation of multi-word expressions(Chiang, 2007) (Koehn et al., 2003) (Och and Ney, 2004).

A pair of substrings [s,t] E and [u,v] F is a phrase pair (Och and Ney, 2004b) if and only if the subset of links emitted from [s,t] in E is equal to the subset of links emitted from [u,v] in F, and both are nonempty.

Title:P09-1019		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Kumar, Shankar; Macherey, Wolfgang; Dyer, Chris; Och, Franz Josef
These two techniques were originally developed for N-best lists of translation hypotheses and recently extended to translation lattices (Macherey et al., 2008; Tromble et al., 2008) generated by a phrase-based SMT system (Och and Ney, 2004). (self citation)

Title:E09-1049		Conference:EACL		Author:Khalilov, Maxim; Fonollosa, Jos&eacute;; A. R.
The word alignment is automatically computed by using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2004) in both directions, which are made symmetric by using the grow-diag-final-and operation.

3.2 Additional features The N-gram translation system implements a loglinear combination of five additional models: an n-gram target LM; 4http://code.google.com/p/giza-pp/ a target LM of Part-of-Speech tags; a word penalty model that is used to compensate for the systems preference for short output sentences; source-to-target and target-to-source lexicon models as shown in Och and Ney (2004)).

Moreover, phrasebased models are unable to cope with global reordering because the distortion model is based on movement distance, which may face computational resource limitations (Och and Ney, 2004).

Title:P09-1103		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Sun, Jun; Zhang, Min; Tan, Chew Lim
Between them, the phrase-based approach (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al, 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) allows local reordering and contiguous phrase translation.

For example, given a source phrase f and a target phrase e, the phrase pair ( f,e) is said to be consistent (Och and Ney, 2004) with the alignment if and only if: (1) there must be at least one word inside one phrase aligned to a word inside the other phrase and (2) no words inside one phrase can be aligned to a word outside the other phrase.

Title:D09-1106		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Liu, Yang; Xia, Tian; Xiao, Xinyan; Liu, Qun
The methods for calculating relative frequencies (Och and Ney, 2004) and lexical weights (Koehn et al., 2003) are also adapted for the weighted matrix case.

Title:D09-1106		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Liu, Yang; Xia, Tian; Xiao, Xinyan; Liu, Qun
Word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source for translation-related knowledge, not only for phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003), but also for syntax-based models (e.g., (Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006)).

Title:D09-1106		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Liu, Yang; Xia, Tian; Xiao, Xinyan; Liu, Qun
After all phrase pairs are extracted from the training corpus, their translation probabilities can be estimated as relative frequencies (Och and Ney, 2004): (e|f) = count( f, e) summationtext e count( f, e) (2) where count( f, e) indicates how often the phrase pair ( f, e) occurs in the training corpus.

We then built separate English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English directed word alignments using IBM model 4 (Brown et al., 1993), combined them using the intersect+grow heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003), and extracted phrase-level translation pairs of maximum length 7 using the alignment template approach (Och and Ney, 2004).

Some of these models are contentindependent, such as distortion models (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) which penalize translation according to jump distance of phrases, and flat reordering model (Wu, 1995; Zens et al., 2004)which assigns constant probabilities for monotone order and non-monotone order.

But each of these three kinds of latent structures may be made explicit using external resources: word-alignment could be considered solved using Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003)), phrase pairs can be obtained from these word-alignments (Och and Ney, 2004), and the hierarchical synchronous structure can be grown over source/target linguistic syntactic trees output by an existing parser.

We can then provide these translations to the decoder, along with their scores, to incorporate them as it builds the complete translation of S. This differs from approaches such as (Och and Ney, 2004) because we generate new phrase pairs in isolation, rather than incorporating everything into the sentence-level decoder.

We only enforce one criterion on Li,ST and Ri,ST : they have to be the maximal alignment blocks satisfying the consistent heuristic (Och and Ney, 2004) that end or start with Yi,ST on the source S side respectively.2 To infer these phrases, we decompose Li,ST into (o(Li,ST), d(FWi1,ST), b(s)); similarly, Ri,ST into (o(Ri,ST),d(FWi+1,ST), b(/s) )).

Query Expansion Using Monolingual SMT 4.1 Linear Models for SMT The job of a translation system is defined in Och and Ney (2004) as finding the English string e that is a translation of a foreign string f using a linear combination of feature functions h m (e, f) and weights m as follows: e = arg max e M summationdisplay m=1 m h m (e, f) As is now standard in SMT, several complex features such as lexical translation models and phrase translation models, trained in source-target and target-source directions, are combined with language models and simple features such as phrase and word counts.

That is, given two Viterbi alignments A 1 = {(a j , j)| a j > 0} and A 2 = {(i, b i )| b i > 0}, the alignments in the intersection are defined as A = A 1 A 2 . Phrases are extracted as larger blocks of aligned words from the alignments in the intersection, as described in Och and Ney (2004).

1 Introduction In recent years, syntax-based translation models (Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006) have shown promising progress in improving translation quality, thanks to the incorporation of phrasal translation adopted from the widely used phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) to handle local fluency and the engagement of synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) to handle non-local phrase reordering.

Widely adopted in phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004), a pair of consecutive sequences of words from E and F is a phrase pair if all words are aligned only within the sequences and not to any word outside.

The estimation of translation model parameters usually relies heavily on word-aligned corpora, not only for phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based models (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Och and Ney 2004; Chiang 2005, 2007), but also for syntax-based models (Quirk, Menezes, and Cherry 2005; Galley et al. 2006; Liu, Liu, and Lin 2006; Marcu et al. 2006).

One approach is to use word alignments (where these can be reliably estimated, as in our testbed application) to align subtrees and extract rules (Och and Ney, 2004; Galley et al., 2004) but this leaves open the question of finding the right level of generality of the rules how deep the rules should be and how much lexicalization they should involve necessitating resorting to heuristics such as minimality of rules, and leading to 1Throughout the paper we will use the word STSG to refer to the tree-to-tree version of the formalism, although the string-to-tree version is also commonly used.

3 Our Approach: Phrase-Based Translation Model for Question Retrieval 3.1 Phrase-Based Translation Model Phrase-based machine translation models (Koehn et al., 2003; D. Chiang, 2005; Och and Ney, 2004) have shown superior performance compared to word-based translation models.

To this end, inspired by the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), we propose a phrasebased translation model (P-Trans) for question retrieval, and we assume that question retrieval should be performed at the phrase level.

Following popular approaches to learning feature weights in the machine translation community (Och and Ney, 2004; Chiang, 2005), we use the minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) algorithm to learn the feature weights that directly optimize certain automatic evaluation metric.
