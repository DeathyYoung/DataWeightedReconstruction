We present a statistical phrase-based transla-tion model that uses hierarchical phrases?phrases that contain subphrases. The modelis formally a synchronous context-free gram-mar but is learned from a bitext without anysyntactic information. Thus it can be seen asa shift to the formal machinery of syntax-based translation systems without any lin-guistic commitment. In our experiments us-ing BLEU as a metric, the hierarchical phrase-based model achieves a relative improve-ment of 7.5% over Pharaoh, a state-of-the-artphrase-based system.

2 Synchronous context-free grammars Several definitions for synchronous context-free grammars have been proposed in the literature; see for instance (Chiang, 2004; Chiang, 2005).

Title:W06-3119		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Zollmann, Andreas; Venugopal, Ashish
While (Chiang, 2005) uses only two nonterminal symbols in his grammar, we introduce multiple syntactic categories, taking advantage of a target language parser for this information.

1 Introduction Recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word (Brown et al. , 1993) and phrase based (Koehn et al. , 2003a) models to include hierarchical phrase models (Chiang, 2005) and bilingual synchronous grammars (Melamed, 2004).

Title:W06-3119		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Zollmann, Andreas; Venugopal, Ashish
Therefore, after annotating the initial rules from the current training sentence pair, we adhere to (Chiang, 2005) to recursively generalize each existing rule; however, we abstract on a per-sentence basis.

Title:W06-3102		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Durgar El-Kahlout, Ilknur; Oflazer, Kemal
To find such groups of morphemes and functional words, we applied a sequence of morpheme groupings by extracting frequently occuring n-grams of morphemes as follows (much like the grouping used by Chiang (2005): in a series of iterations, we obtained high-frequency bigrams from the morphemic representation of parallel texts, of either morphemes, or of previously such identified morpheme groups and neighboring morphemes until up to four morphemes or one root 3 morpheme could be combined.

Manual alignments are represented by two sets: Probable (P) alignments and Sure (S) alignments, where S P. Given A,P and S, the most commonly used metricsprecision (Pr), recall (Rc) and alignment error rate (AER)are defined as follows: Pr = |AP||A| Rc = |AS||S| AER = 1 |AS|+|AP||A|+|S| Another approach to evaluating alignments is to measure their impact on an external application, e.g., statistical MT. In recent years, phrase-based systems (Koehn, 2004; Chiang, 2005) have been shown to outperform word-based MT systems; therefore,inthispaper,weuseapublicly-available phrase-based MT system, Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004), to investigate the impact of different alignments.

Title:P06-1002		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Ayan, Necip Fazil; Dorr, Bonnie Jean
Although it is possible to estimate phrases directly from a training corpus (Marcu and Wong, 2002), most phrase-based MT systems (Koehn, 2004; Chiang, 2005) start with a word alignment and extract phrases that are consistent with the given alignment.

Title:N06-3004		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics - Doctoral Consortium		Author:Huang, Liang
When tested on top of two state-of-the-art systems, the Collins/Bikel parser (Bikel, 2004) and Chiangs CKY-based Hiero decoder (Chiang, 2005), this algorithm is shown to have very little overhead even for quite large k (say, 106) (See Fig.

Title:N06-3004		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics - Doctoral Consortium		Author:Huang, Liang
Many researchers have explored syntax-based methods, for instance, Wu (1996) and Chiang (2005) both uses binary-branching synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs).

Additionally, we incorporate the pruning techniques used in (Chiang 2005), by which any hypothesis with a probability lower thantimes the highest probability for one sentence is discarded.

Title:N06-1002		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Quirk, Chris; Menezes, Arul
Recent research into syntaxbased SMT (Quirk and Menezes 2005; Chiang 2005) has produced promising results in addressing some of the problems; research motivated by other statistical models has helped to address others (Banchs et al. 2005).

Title:N06-1002		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Quirk, Chris; Menezes, Arul
Hierarchical phrases Recent work in the use of hierarchical phrases (Chiang 2005) improves the ability to capture linguistic generalizations, and also removes the limitation to contiguous phrases.

Title:N06-1002		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Quirk, Chris; Menezes, Arul
Given a fixed length limit, the number of surface phrases extracted from any sentence pair of length n where all words are uniquely aligned is O(n), but the number of treelets is potentially exponential in the number of children; and the number of rules with two gaps extracted by Chiang (2005) is potentially O(n3).

A systematic analysis of the novel training algorithm will allow us to include much more sophisticated features in future experiments, i.e. POSbased features, syntactic or hierarchical features (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P06-1091		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Tillmann, Christoph; Zhang, Tong
While error-driven training techniques are commonly used to improve the performance of phrasebased translation systems (Chiang, 2005; Och, 2003), this paper presents a novel block sequence translation approach to SMT that is similar to sequential natural language annotation problems 727 such as part-of-speech tagging or shallow parsing, both in modeling and parameter training.

Title:W06-1628		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Cowan, Brooke; Kucerova, Ivona; Collins, Michael John
Chiang (2005) has recently shown significant improvements in translation accuracy, using synchronous grammars.

Title:N06-1032		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Riezler, Stefan; Maxwell III, John T.
1A notable exception to this kind of approach is Chiang (2005) who introduces syntactic information into phrase-based SMT via hierarchical phrases rather than by external parsing.

Title:P06-1123		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Wellington, Benjamin; Waxmonsky, Sonjia; Melamed, I. Dan
Analogous techniques for tree-structured translation models involve either allowing each nonterminal to generate both terminals and other nonterminals (Groves et al. , 2004; Chiang, 2005), or, given a constraining parse tree, to flatten it (Fox, 2002; Zens and Ney, 2003; Galley et al. , 2004).

Title:W06-3115		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
The other is a hierarchical phrase-based translation in which translation is realized as a set of paired production rules (Chiang, 2005).

Title:W06-3115		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
In a phrase-based statistical translation (Koehn et al. , 2003), a bilingual text is decomposed as K phrase translation pairs (e1, fa1), (e2, fa2 ),: The input foreign sentence is segmented into phrases f K1, 122 mapped into corresponding English eK1, then, reordered to form the output English sentence according to a phrase alignment index mapping a. In a hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005), translation is modeled after a weighted synchronous-CFG consisting of production rules whose right-hand side is paired (Aho and Ullman, 1969): X ,, where X is a non-terminal, and are strings of terminals and non-terminals.

Title:W06-3115		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
The method exhaustively extracts phrase pairs ( f j+mj, ei+ni ) from a sentence pair ( f J1, eI1) that do not violate the word alignment constraints a. In the hierarchical phrase-based model, production rules are accumulated by computing holes for extracted contiguous phrases (Chiang, 2005): 1.

Title:P06-1066		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Xiong, Deyi; Liu, Qun; Lin, Shouxun
Another smart reordering model was proposed by Chiang (2005).

Title:P06-1066		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Xiong, Deyi; Liu, Qun; Lin, Shouxun
Given an input sentence c, the final translation e is derived from the best derivation D D = argmax c(D)=c Pr(D) e = e(D) (8) 2.2 Decoder We developed a CKY style decoder that employs a beam search algorithm, similar to the one by Chiang (2005).

Title:P06-1066		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Xiong, Deyi; Liu, Qun; Lin, Shouxun
These features are very common in state-of-the-art systems (Koehn et al. , 2005; Chiang, 2005) and s are weights of features.

Title:P06-1066		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Xiong, Deyi; Liu, Qun; Lin, Shouxun
From this point, our decoder is similar to the work by Chiang (2005).

Title:N06-1031		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Huang, Bryant; Knight, Kevin
Some approaches have used syntax at the core (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. , 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003; Hearne and Way, 2003; Melamed, 2004) while others have integrated syntax into existing phrase-based frameworks (Xia and McCord, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Collins et al. , 2005; Quirk et al. , 2005).

Title:W06-1606		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Marcu, Daniel; Wang, Wei; Echihabi, Abdessamad; Knight, Kevin
5 Discussion The SPMT models are similar to the models proposed by Chiang (2005) and Galley et al.

Title:W06-1606		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Marcu, Daniel; Wang, Wei; Echihabi, Abdessamad; Knight, Kevin
And syntax-inspired formal models (Chiang, 2005), in spite of being trained on significantly less data, have shown promising results when compared on the same test sets with mature phrase-based systems.

Title:P06-2036		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Gildea, Daniel; Satta, Giorgio; Zhang, Hao
Variations of SCFGs go back to Aho and Ullman (1972)s Syntax-Directed Translation Schemata, but also include the Inversion Transduction Grammars in Wu (1997), which restrict grammar rules to be binary, the synchronous grammars in Chiang (2005), which use only a single nonterminal symbol, and the Multitext Grammars in Melamed (2003), which allow independent rewriting, as well as other tree-based models such as Yamada and Knight (2001) and Galley et al.

Title:P06-1077		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Liu, Yang; Liu, Qun; Lin, Shouxun
Chiang (2005) presents a hierarchical phrasebased model that uses hierarchical phrase pairs, which are formally productions of a synchronous context-free grammar.

Title:P06-1077		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Liu, Yang; Liu, Qun; Lin, Shouxun
As we restrict that T(fj2j1 ) must be a subtree of T(fJ1 ), TATs may be treated as syntactic hierar612 chical phrase pairs (Chiang, 2005) with tree structure on the source side.

Title:W06-3106		Conference:Workshop On Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Langlais, Philippe; Gotti, Fabrizio
(Chiang, 2005) proposes an heuristic way of acquiring context free transfer rules that significantly improves upon a standard phrase-based model.

Title:P06-1121		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Galley, Michel; Graehl, Jonathan; Knight, Kevin; Marcu, Daniel; DeNeefe, Steve; Wang, Wei; Thayer, Ignacio
While the state-of-the-art hierarchical SMT system (Chiang, 2005) performs well despite stringent constraints imposed on its context-free grammar, we believe its main advantage lies in its ability to extract hierarchical rules across phrasal boundaries.

Title:P06-1121		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Galley, Michel; Graehl, Jonathan; Knight, Kevin; Marcu, Daniel; DeNeefe, Steve; Wang, Wei; Thayer, Ignacio
7 Related work Similarly to (Poutsma, 2000; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005), the rules discussed in this paper are equivalent to productions of synchronous tree substitution grammars.

Title:P06-1121		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Galley, Michel; Graehl, Jonathan; Knight, Kevin; Marcu, Daniel; DeNeefe, Steve; Wang, Wei; Thayer, Ignacio
We believe it will be beneficial to account for this finding in future work in syntax-based SMT and in efforts to improve upon (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P06-1098		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
Chiang (2005) introduced a hierarchical phrasebased translation model that combined the strength of the phrase-based approach and a synchronous-CFG formalism (Aho and Ullman, 1969): A rewrite system initiated from a start symbol which synchronously rewrites paired nonterminals.

Title:P06-1098		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
Rules are induced from a bilingual corpus without linguistic clues first by extracting phrase translation pairs, and then by generalizing extracted phrases with holes (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P06-1098		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
Our model is based on Chiang (2005)s framework, but further restricts the form of production rules so that the aligned right-hand side follows a GNF-like structure: X angbracketleftBig , b, angbracketrightBig (7) where b is a string of terminals, or a phrase, and beta is a (possibly empty) string of nonterminals.

Title:P06-1098		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
The method exhaustively extracts phrase pairs ( f j+mj, ei+ni ) from a sentence pair ( f J1, eI1) that do not violate the word alignment constraints a: (i, j)a : j[ j, j + m], i[i, i + n] (i, j)a : j[ j, j + m], i nelement [i, i + n] (i, j)a : j nelement [ j, j + m], i[i, i + n] Third, based on the extracted phrases, production rules are accumulated by computing the holes for contiguous phrases (Chiang, 2005): 1.

Title:P06-1098		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
In the hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005), and an inversion transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997), the problem is resolved by restricting to a binarized form where at most two non-terminals are allowed in the righthand side.

Title:P06-1098		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
Chiang (2005) proposed a hierarchical phrasebased translation model, a binary synchronousCFG, which restricted the form of production rules as follows: Only two types of non-terminals allowed: S and X. Both of the strings and must contain at least one terminal item.

Title:P06-1098		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
The hierarchical phrase-based model avoided this problem by introducing the glue rules 5 and 6 that combined hierarchical phrases sequentially (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P06-1098		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Watanabe, Taro; Tsukada, Hajime; Isozaki, Hideki
The procedure is based on those for the hierarchical phrase-based translation model (Chiang, 2005).

5 Experiments We used the N-best list generated by the Hiero SMT system (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P06-1096		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Liang, Percy; Bouchard-C&ocirc;t&eacute;, Alexandre; Klein, Dan; Taskar, Ben
The first approach is to reuse the components of a generative model, but tune their relative weights in a discriminative fashion (Och and Ney, 2002; Och, 2003; Chiang, 2005).

Title:P06-1096		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Liang, Percy; Bouchard-C&ocirc;t&eacute;, Alexandre; Klein, Dan; Taskar, Ben
Another example of this framework is the hierarchical model of Chiang (2005).

Title:P06-1096		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Liang, Percy; Bouchard-C&ocirc;t&eacute;, Alexandre; Klein, Dan; Taskar, Ben
In the future, we plan to explore our discriminative framework on a full distortion model (Koehn et al. , 2003) or even a hierarchical model (Chiang, 2005).

Title:N06-1056		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Wong, Yuk Wah; Mooney, Raymond J.
Synchronous parsing has seen a surge of interest recently in the machine translation community as a way of formalizing syntax-based translation models (Melamed, 2004; Chiang, 2005).

Title:N06-1056		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Wong, Yuk Wah; Mooney, Raymond J.
It is also similar to the hierarchical phrase-based model of Chiang (2005), in which hierarchical phrase pairs, essentially SCFG rules, are learned through the use of a simpler, phrase-based alignment model.

Title:N06-1056		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Wong, Yuk Wah; Mooney, Raymond J.
Complete MRs are then formed by combining these NL substrings and their translations under a parsing framework called the synchronous CFG (Aho and Ullman, 1972), which forms the basis of most existing statistical syntax-based translation models (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005).

Title:N06-1033		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Hao; Huang, Liang; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
However, in the source-channel approach to machine translation, we need to combine probabilities from the translation model (an SCFG) with the language model (an ngram), which has been shown to be very important for translation quality (Chiang, 2005).

Title:N06-1033		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Hao; Huang, Liang; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
One way around this dif culty is to stipulate that all rules must be binary from the outset, as in inversion-transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997) and the binary synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) employed by the Hiero system (Chiang, 2005) to model the hierarchical phrases.

Title:N06-1033		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Hao; Huang, Liang; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
1 Introduction Several recent syntax-based models for machine translation (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al. , 2004) can be seen as instances of the general framework of synchronous grammars and tree transducers.

Title:N06-1033		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Hao; Huang, Liang; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
2In making one nonterminal play dual roles, we follow the de nitions in (Aho and Ullman, 1972; Chiang, 2005), originally known as Syntax Directed Translation Schema (SDTS).

Title:N06-1033		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Hao; Huang, Liang; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
As illustrated in Figure 2, VPP-VP has contiguous spans on both source and target sides, so that we can generate a binary-branching SCFG: (2) S NP (1) V PP-VP (2), NP(1) V PP-VP (2) VPP-VP VP(1) PP(2), PP(2) VP(1) In this case m-gram integrated decoding can be done in O(|w|3+4(m1)) time which is much lowerorder polynomial and no longer depends on rule size (Wu, 1996), allowing the search to be much faster and more accurate facing pruning, as is evidenced in the Hiero system of Chiang (2005) where he restricts the hierarchical phrases to be a binary SCFG.

Title:P06-2122		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Zhang, Hao; Gildea, Daniel
Synchronous grammar formalisms that are capable of modeling such complex relationships while maintaining the context-free property in each language have been proposed for many years, (Aho and Ullman, 1972; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Melamed, 2003; Chiang, 2005), but have not been scaled to large corpora and long sentences until recently.

Title:W06-3601		Conference:Workshop On Computationally Hard Problems And Joint Inference In Speech And Language Processing		Author:Huang, Liang; Knight, Kevin; Joshi, Aravind K.
Both Yamada and Knight (2001) and Chiang (2005) use SCFGs as the underlying model, so their translation schemata are syntax-directed as in Fig.

Title:W06-3601		Conference:Workshop On Computationally Hard Problems And Joint Inference In Speech And Language Processing		Author:Huang, Liang; Knight, Kevin; Joshi, Aravind K.
Besides, our model, as being linguistically motivated, is also more expressive than the formally syntax-based models of Chiang (2005) and Wu (1997).

Title:W06-3601		Conference:Workshop On Computationally Hard Problems And Joint Inference In Speech And Language Processing		Author:Huang, Liang; Knight, Kevin; Joshi, Aravind K.
In contrast, their decodings are reported to be computationally expensive and Chiang (2005) uses aggressive pruning to make it tractable.

Title:P07-1002		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Chang, Pi-Chuan; Toutanova, Kristina
Alternatively, order is modelled in terms of movement of automatically induced hierarchical structure of sentences (Chiang, 2005; Wu, 1997).

There have been considerable amount of efforts to improve the reordering model in SMT systems, ranging from the fundamental distance-based distortion model (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003), flat reordering model (Wu, 1996; Zens et al. , 2004; Kumar et al. , 2005), to lexicalized reordering model (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar et al. , 2005; Koehn et al. , 2005), hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005), and maximum entropy-based phrase reordering model (Xiong et al. , 2006).

3.2 Model Similar to the work in Chiang (2005), our translation model can be formulated as a weighted synchronous context free grammar derivation process.

For Rule (3)~(9), according to the syntactic structures, their application is determined since there is only one choice to complete reordering, which is similar to the glue rules in Chiang (2005).

35 3.1 String-based Approaches String-based approaches include both string-tostring (Chiang, 2005) and string-to-tree systems (Galley et al. , 2006).2 To simplify the presentation we will just focus on the former but the analysis also applies to the latter.

We compare it with the other two schemes in two popular instantiations of MT systems based on SCFGs: the string-based systems (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al. , 2006) where the input is a string to be parsed using the source-side of the SCFG; and the treebased systems (Liu et al. , 2006; Huang et al. , 2006) where the input is a parse tree and is recursively converted into a target string using the SCFG as a tree-transducer.

Further, the ratio p(eq(lexmid))/p(ee1) adjusts the LM probabilities of Ps instantiation given its left context, and p[q(elexmid)q(end)]/p[q(ee1)q(end)] adjusts the LM probabilities of the g 1 words right of P. 4 Alternative Approaches We evaluate our two pass hypergraph search H.Search against the strong single pass Cube Pruning (CP) baseline as mentioned in (Chiang, 2005) and detailed in (Chiang, 2007).

(Galley et al. , 2006) use syntactic constituents for the PSCFG nonterminal set and (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) take advantage of CCG (Steedman, 1999) categories, while (Chiang, 2005) uses a single generic nonterminal.

1 Introduction For statistical machine translation (SMT), phrasebased methods (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based methods (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. 2000; Yamada and Knignt, 2001; Melamed, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Quick et al. , 2005; Mellebeek et al. , 2006) outperform word-based methods (Brown et al. , 1993).

The benefit of introducing lexical evidence without being fully lexicalized has been demonstrated by a recent state-of-the-art formally syntax-based model1, Hiero (Chiang, 2005).

(2004), and Chiang (2005) all fall into this category.

Title:J07-1003		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Ueffing, Nicola; Ney, Hermann
Nowadays, most state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases (Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999; Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Tillmann 2003; Bertoldi et al. 2004; Vogel et al. 2004; Zens and Ney 2004; Chiang 2005).

Although, this situation does not arise often in our dataset, we believe that it can be ameliorated by intersecting a language model with our generation algorithm (Chiang, 2005).

Among the first to demonstrate improvement when adding recursive structure was (Chiang, 2005), who allows for hierarchical phrase probabilities that handle a range of reordering phenomena in the correct fashion.

A few exceptions are the hierarchical (possibly syntax-based) transduction models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. , 1998; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) and the string transduction models (Kanthak et al. , 2005).

Most stateof-the-art SMT systems treat grammatical elements in exactly the same way as content words, and rely on general-purpose phrasal translations and target language models to generate these elements (e.g. , Och and Ney, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Quirk et al. , 2005; Chiang, 2005; Galley et al. , 2006).

To address these concerns, hierarchically structured models as in Chiang (2005) define weighted transduction rules, interpretable as components of a probabilistic synchronous grammar (Aho and Ullman, 1969) that represent translation and reordering operations.

This is higher than the score of 28.77 reported in (Chiang, 2005), perhaps due to differences in word segmentation, etc. Note that comparing with the MT systems used in (Carpuat and Wu, 2005) and (Cabezas and Resnik, 2005), the Hiero system we are using represents a much stronger baseline MT system upon which the WSD system must improve.

1 Introduction The recent advances in statistical machine translation have been achieved by discriminatively training a small number of real-valued features based either on (hierarchical) phrase-based translation (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003; Chiang, 2005) or syntax-based translation (Galley et al. , 2006).

The hierarchical phrase translation pairs are extracted in a standard way (Chiang, 2005): First, the bilingual data are word alignment annotated by running GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) in two directions.

Title:W07-0410		Conference:SSST, NAACL-HLT 2007 / AMTA Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation		Author:Font Llitjos, Ariadna; Vogel, Stephan
Actually, now that SMT has reached some maturity, we see several attempts to integrate more structure into these systems, ranging from simple hierarchical alignment models (Wu 1997, Chiang 2005) to syntax-based statistical systems (Yamada and Knight 2001, Zollmann and Venugopal 2006).

Title:W07-0735		Conference:Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Bojar, Ond&#x159;ej
As an alternative option to our verb-modifier experiments, structured language models (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) might be considered to improve clause coherence, until full-featured syntax-based MT models (Yamada and Knight (2002), Eisner (2003), Chiang (2005) among many others) are tested when translating to morphologically rich languages.

Title:W07-0413		Conference:SSST, NAACL-HLT 2007 / AMTA Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation		Author:Venkatapathy, Sriram; Bangalore, Srinivas
A few exceptions are the hierarchical (possibly syntaxbased) transduction models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. , 1998; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) and the string transduction models (Kanthak et al. , 2005).

Title:P07-1040		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Rosti, Antti-Veikko I.; Matsoukas, Spyros; Schwartz, Richard M.
Six MT systems were combined: three (A,C,E) were phrasebased similar to (Koehn, 2004), two (B,D) were hierarchical similar to (Chiang, 2005) and one (F) was syntax-based similar to (Galley et al. , 2006).

The model of Chiang (2005) employs a synchronous context-free grammar to allow hierarchical approaches to reordering.

Title:D07-1077		Conference:2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL)		Author:Wang, Chao; Collins, Michael John; Koehn, Philipp
More recently developed hierarchical systems (e.g. , (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al. , 2006)) may be better equipped to deal with reordering of this type; however, in this example they would effectively have to first identify the span of the relative clause, and then move it into the correct position, without any explicit representation of the source language syntax.

Title:P07-1121		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Wong, Yuk Wah; Mooney, Raymond J.
Both formalisms have led to SMT systems whose performance is state-of-the-art (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al. , 2006).

These tree pairs might be manually generated, automatically reconstructed from repurposed bilingual dictionaries, or automatically induced from aligned bilingual treebanks (Groves et al. , 2004; Groves and Way, 2005) or even unannotated bilingual corpora (Chiang, 2005).

Successful experiments such as those of Chiang (2005) using synchronous context-free grammar are a good first start.4 2.3 Heritage of the construction principle We have argued that a formalism expressive enough to model the translation relation implicit in bilingual dictionaries must be based on relations over constructions, the primitive relations found in such bilingual dictionaries and founded by the Construction Principle.

More recently, (Chiang, 2005) extended phrase-pairs (or blocks) to hierarchical phrase-pairs where a grammar with a single non-terminal allows the embedding of phrases-pairs, to allow for arbitrary embedding and capture global reordering though this approach still has the high overlap problem.

1 Introduction Over the last several years, various statistical syntaxbased models were proposed to extend traditional word/phrase based models in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Lin, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Ding et al. , 2005; Quirk et al. , 2005; Marcu et al. , 2006; Liu et al. , 2006).

Title:D07-1079		Conference:2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL)		Author:DeNeefe, Steve; Knight, Kevin; Wang, Wei; Marcu, Daniel
Approaches include word substitution systems (Brown et al. , 1993), phrase substitution systems (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), and synchronous context-free grammar systems (Wu and Wong, 1998; Chiang, 2005), all of which train on string pairs and seek to establish connections between source and target strings.

Title:P07-1051		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Bod, Rens
Thus similar to Chiang (2005), U-DOP can discover non-syntactic phrases, or simply phrases, which are typically neglected by linguistically syntax-based MT systems.

As our first step, we will assume that the system will be learning from a corpus consisting of triplesf,e,a, where: (i) f is a sentence from our source language, which is parsed (the words of the sentence and the nodes of the parse tree may or may not be annotated with auxiliary information), (ii) e is a gold-standard translation of sentence f (the words of sentence e may or may not be annotated with auxiliary information), and (iii) a is an automaticallygenerated word alignment (e.g. via GIZA++) between source sentence f and destination sentence e. 1(Chiang, 2005) also reports that with his hierarchical generalization of the phrase-based approach, the addition of parser information doesnt lead to any improvements.

Examples of such efforts include work on the induction of synchronous grammars (Wu and Wong, 1998; Chiang, 2005) and learning multilingual lexical resources (Genzel, 2005).

Title:D08-1021		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Callison-Burch, Chris
Phrase-based rules have also been replaced with synchronous context free grammars (Chiang, 2005) and with tree fragments (Huang and Knight, 2006).

Title:P08-1064		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Aw, Aiti; Li, Haizhou; Tan, Chew Lim; Li, Sheng
However, formal SCFG show much better performance in the formally syntax-based translation framework (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P08-1064		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Aw, Aiti; Li, Haizhou; Tan, Chew Lim; Li, Sheng
This is because the formal syntax is learned from phrases directly without relying on any linguistic theory (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P08-1064		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Aw, Aiti; Li, Haizhou; Tan, Chew Lim; Li, Sheng
Chiang (2005)s hierarchal phrase-based model achieves significant performance improvement.

Title:P08-1064		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Aw, Aiti; Li, Haizhou; Tan, Chew Lim; Li, Sheng
However, no further significant improvement is achieved when the model is made sensitive to syntactic structures by adding a constituent feature (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P08-1064		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Aw, Aiti; Li, Haizhou; Tan, Chew Lim; Li, Sheng
Recently, many syntax-based models have been proposed to address the above deficiencies (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Gildea, 2003; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003).

Recent work on reordering has been on trying to find smart ways to decide word order, using syntactic features such as POS tags (Lee and Ge 2005) , parse trees (Zhang et.al, 2007, Wang et.al. 2007, Collins et.al. 2005, Yamada and Knight 2001) to name just a few, and synchronized CFG (Wu 1997, Chiang 2005), again to name just a few.

Title:W08-0408		Conference:Proceedings of the ACL-08: HLT Second Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-2)		Author:Ge, Niyu; Ittycheriah, Abraham; Papineni, Kishore
We show how to use this framework to perform distance-based reordering and HIERO-style (Chiang 2005) hierarchical reordering.

Title:W08-0408		Conference:Proceedings of the ACL-08: HLT Second Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-2)		Author:Ge, Niyu; Ittycheriah, Abraham; Papineni, Kishore
3.2 HIERO Hierarchical Reordering In this section we show an example of how the Hiero decoding method (Chiang 2005) can be implemented as a reordering module in this framework.

Title:W08-0408		Conference:Proceedings of the ACL-08: HLT Second Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-2)		Author:Ge, Niyu; Ittycheriah, Abraham; Papineni, Kishore
Given the above Chinese input and the two Hiero rules, the Hiero decoder as described in (Chiang 2005) will produce a partial hypothesis Australia is one of by firing the two rules during parsing (see Chiang 2005 for decoding details).

Title:D08-1089		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Galley, Michel; Manning, Christopher D.
Coming from the other direction, such observations about phrase reordering between different languages are precisely thekindsoffactsthatparsingapproachestomachine translation are designed to handle and do successfully handle (Wu, 1997; Melamed, 2003; Chiang, 2005).

Title:D08-1089		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Galley, Michel; Manning, Christopher D.
Crucially, our work distinguishes itself from previous hierarchical models in that it does not rely on any cubic-time parsing algorithms such as CKY (used in, e.g., (Chiang, 2005)) or the Earley algorithm (used in (Watanabe et al., 2006)).

Title:D08-1089		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Galley, Michel; Manning, Christopher D.
To be able identify that adjacent blocks (e.g., the development and and progress) can be merged into larger blocks, our model infers binary (non-linguistic) trees reminiscent of (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005).

Title:D08-1076		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Macherey, Wolfgang; Och, Franz Josef; Thayer, Ignacio; Uszkoreit, Jakob
It is also straightforward to extend the suggested method to hypergraphs and forests as they are used, e.g., in hierarchical and syntax-augmented systems (Chiang, 2005; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).

We used both a phrase-based translation model, decoded using our modified version of Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and a hierarchical phrase-based translation model, using our modified version of Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).

Title:P08-1115		Conference:Proceedings of the 9th SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue		Author:Dyer, Chris; Muresan, Smaranda; Resnik, Philip
In addition, we generalize lattice decoding algorithmically, extending it for the first time to hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).

Title:C08-1138		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Li, Haizhou; Aw, Aiti; Li, Sheng
This is because the formal syntax is learned from phrase translational equivalences directly without relying on any linguistic theory (Chiang, 2005).

Title:C08-1138		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Li, Haizhou; Aw, Aiti; Li, Sheng
As indicated before (Chiang, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007), the above scheme generates a very large number of rules, which not only makes the system too complicated but also introduces too many undesirable ambiguities.

Title:C08-1138		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Li, Haizhou; Aw, Aiti; Li, Sheng
Our analysis further finds that 4 This claim is mainly hold for linguistically-informed SCFG since formal SCFG and BTG already showed much better performance in the formally syntax-based translation framework (Chiang, 2005).

Title:C08-1138		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Min; Jiang, Hongfei; Li, Haizhou; Aw, Aiti; Li, Sheng
Based on these grammars, a great number of SMT models have been recently proposed, including string-to-string model (Synchronous FSG) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-string model (TSG-string) (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007), string-totree model (string-CFG/TSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), tree-to-tree model (Synchronous CFG/TSG, Data-Oriented Translation) (Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Quirk wt al., 2005; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003) and so on.

Our rule extraction algorithm is an extension of that presented at (Chiang, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007).

Title:D08-1060		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Zhao, Bing; Al-Onaizan, Yaser
Such rules are not allowed in Hiero-style models, as there is no lexical item between the two variables (Chiang, 2005) in the source side.

Title:D08-1060		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Zhao, Bing; Al-Onaizan, Yaser
Slightly different from the decoder in (Chiang, 2005), we implemented the dotted-rule in Early-style parser to handle rules containing more than two variables.

Title:D08-1060		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Zhao, Bing; Al-Onaizan, Yaser
The rules we extract belong to one of the following categories: contains only words, and lscript is NULL; this corresponds to the general blocks used in phrasebased decoder (Och and Ney, 2004); contains words and variables of [X,0] and [X,1], and lscript is NULL; this corresponds to the Hiero rules as in Chiang (2005); contains words and variables in the form of [X,TAG2], in which TAG is from the LDC tagset; this defines a well formed subtree, in which at least one child (constituent) is aligned to continuous target ngrams.

Title:D08-1060		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Zhao, Bing; Al-Onaizan, Yaser
We adopt the notations used in (Chiang, 2005).

Title:D08-1060		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Zhao, Bing; Al-Onaizan, Yaser
This usually leads to too many redundant translations, which worsens the spurious ambiguities (Chiang, 2005) problems for both decoding and optimization (i.e., parameter tuning).

Title:D08-1060		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Zhao, Bing; Al-Onaizan, Yaser
Another method to address the re-ordering problem in translation is the Hiero model proposed by Chiang (2005), in which a probabilistic synchronous context free grammar (PSCFG) was applied to guide the decoding.

Chiang (2005) distinguishes statistical MT approaches that are syntactic in a formal sense, going beyond the nite-state underpinnings of phrasebased models, from approaches that are syntactic in a linguistic sense, i.e. taking advantage of a priori language knowledge in the form of annotations derived from human linguistic analysis or treebanking.1 The two forms of syntactic modeling are doubly dissociable: current research frameworks include systems that are nite state but informed by linguistic annotation prior to training (e.g., (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Birch et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2007)), and also include systems employing contextfree models trained on parallel text without bene t of any prior linguistic analysis (e.g.

1004 Chiang (2005) conjectured that there might be value in allowing the Hiero model to favor hypotheses for which the synchronous derivation respects linguistically motivated source-language constituency boundaries, as identi ed using a parser.

2 Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation 2.1 Hiero Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) is a hierarchical phrase-based statistical MT framework that generalizes phrase-based models by permitting phrases with gaps.

3 Soft Syntactic Constraints, Revisited On the face of it, there are any number of possible reasons Chiangs (2005) soft constraint did not work including, for example, practical issues like the quality of the Chinese parses.5 However, we focus here on two conceptual issues underlying his use of source language syntactic constituents.

In addition to the baseline condition, and baseline plus Chiangs (2005) original constituency feature, experimental conditions augmented the baseline with additional features as described in Section 3.

7 Conclusion When hierarchical phrase-based translation was introduced by Chiang (2005), it represented a new and successful way to incorporate syntax into statistical MT, allowing the model to exploit non-local dependencies and lexically sensitive reordering without requiring linguistically motivated parsing of either the source or target language.

Title:P08-1114		Conference:Proceedings of the 9th SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue		Author:Marton, Yuval; Resnik, Philip
Second, the Chiang (2005) constituency feature gives a rule additional credit when the rules source side overlaps exactly with a source-side syntactic constituent.

1 Introduction Formal grammar used in statistical machine translation (SMT), such as Bracketing Transduction Grammar (BTG) proposed by (Wu, 1997) and the synchronous CFG presented by (Chiang, 2005), provides a natural platform for integrating linguistic knowledge into SMT because hierarchical structures produced by the formal grammar resemble linguistic structures.

Title:P08-1023		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Mi, Haitao; Huang, Liang; Liu, Qun
Depending on the type of input, these efforts can be divided into two broad categories: the string-based systems whose input is a string to be simultaneously parsed and translated by a synchronous grammar (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006), and the tree-based systems whose input is already a parse tree to be directly converted into a target tree or string (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).

Title:P08-1023		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Mi, Haitao; Huang, Liang; Liu, Qun
These phrases are called syntactic phrases which are consistent with syntactic constituents (Chiang, 2005), and have been shown to be helpful in tree-based systems (Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).

In our previous work (He et al., 2008), we reported improvements by integrating a MERS model into a formally syntax-based SMT model, the hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005).

2.4 Decoding Following previous work on hierarchical MT (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006), we solve decoding as chart parsing.

Hierarchical rules were extracted from a subset which has about 35M/41M words5, and the rest of the training data were used to extract phrasal rules as in (Och, 2003; Chiang, 2005).

However, while Chiang (2005) stores an abbreviated context composed of the n 1 target words on the left and right edge of the target substring, here we store the entire target string.

Title:I08-2087		Conference:Proceedings of the Third International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing		Author:Zhang, Dakun; Sun, Le; Li, Wenbo
However, formally syntax-based methods propose simple but efficient ways to parse and translate sentences (Wu 1997; Chiang 2005).

To make things worse, modern statistical parsers are often trained on domains quite different from those used in MT. By contrast, formally syntax-based models (Chiang, 2005) do not rely on parse trees, yet usually perform better than these linguistically sophisticated counterparts.

The final result with both forest-based extraction and forest-based decoding reaches a BLEU score of 0.2816, outperforming that of Hiero (Chiang, 2005), one of the best performing systems to date.

2.2 The Hierarchical Model The hierarchical model (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) is built on a weighted synchronous contextfree grammar (SCFG) . A SCFG rule has the following form: X ,,(4) where X is a nonterminal, is an LHS string consists of terminals and nonterminals, is the translation of , defines a one-one correspondence between nonterminals in and .

In (Chiang, 2005), the log-linear model combines 8 features: the translation probabilities P(|) and P(|), the lexical weights P w (|) and P w (|), the language model, the word penalty, the phrase penalty, and the glue rule penalty.

Title:C08-1041		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:He, Zhongjun; Liu, Qun; Lin, Shouxun
Take the hierarchical model (Chiang, 2005) as an example.

These features can be easily gathered according to Chinags rule extraction method (Chiang, 2005).

1 Introduction The syntax-based statistical machine translation (SMT) models (Chiang, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) use rules with hierarchical structures as translation knowledge, which can capture long-distance reorderings.

Title:C08-1041		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:He, Zhongjun; Liu, Qun; Lin, Shouxun
Note that following (Chiang, 2005), we limit the number of nonterminals of a rule up to 2.

Coming up-to-date, (Blunsom et al., 2008) attempt a related estimation problem to (Marcu and Wong, 2002), using the expanded phrase pair set of (Chiang, 2005a), working with an exponential model and concentrating on marginalizing out the latent segmentation variable.

We use binary Synchronous ContextFree Grammar (bSCFG), based on Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005a), to define the set of eligible segmentations for an aligned sentence pair.

PSCFG approaches such as Chiang (2005) and Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) typically begin with a phrase-based model as the foundation for the PSCFG rules described above.

2.2 Hierarchical MT Building upon the success of phrase-based methods, Chiang (2005) presents a PSCFG model of translation that uses the bilingual phrase pairs of phrase-based MT as starting point to learn hierarchicalrules.

While previous work demonstrates impres1145 sive improvements of PSCFG over phrase-based approaches for large Chinese-to-English data scenarios (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007; Marcu et al., 2006; DeNeefe et al., 2007), these phrase-based baseline systems were constrained to distortion limits of four (Chiang, 2005) and seven (Chiang, 2007; Marcu et al., 2006; DeNeefe et al., 2007), respectively, while the PSCFG systems were able to operate within an implicit reordering window of 10 and higher.

Whenever we combine two dynamic programming items, we need to score the fluency of their concatentation by incorporating the score of any language model features which cross the target side boundaries of the two concatenated items (Chiang, 2005).

The Hiero-style rules of (Chiang, 2005), which are not strictly binary but binary only on nonterminals: X yu X(1) you X(2); have X(2) with X(1) can be handled similarly through either offline binarization or allowing a fixed maximum number of gap words between the right hand side nonterminals in the decoder.

Extraction of such phrases is a common feature of state-of-the-art phrase-based and syntax-based machine translation systems (Och and Ney, 2004a; Chiang, 2005). (self citation)

Title:C08-1136		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhang, Hao; Gildea, Daniel; Chiang, David
From wordlevel alignments, such systems extract the grammar rules consistent either with the alignments and parse trees for one of languages (Galley et al., 2004), or with the the word-level alignments alone without reference to external syntactic analysis (Chiang, 2005), which is the scenario we address here.

1 Introduction Recently Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems based on Synchronous Context Free Grammar (SCFG) have been extensively investigated (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) and have achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Title:P09-1009		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Snyder, Benjamin; Naseem, Tahira; Barzilay, Regina
More general formalisms for the same purpose were later developed (Wu and Wong, 1998; Chiang, 2005; Melamed, 2003; Eisner, 2003; Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Blunsom et al., 2008).

Title:W09-0436		Conference:Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Chang, Pi-Chuan; Jurafsky, Daniel; Manning, Christopher D.
Part of the solution to dealing with these ordering issues is hierarchical decoding, such as the Hiero system (Chiang, 2005), a method motivated by {(DE) examples like the one in Figure 1.

1 Introduction Hierarchical approaches to machine translation have proven increasingly successful in recent years (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008), and often outperform phrase-based systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) on target-language fluency and adequacy.

Title:D09-1073		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Zhang, Min; Li, Haizhou
Recently, many phrase reordering methods have been proposed, ranging from simple distancebased distortion model (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), flat reordering model (Wu, 1997; Zens et al., 2004), lexicalized reordering model (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005), to hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005; Setiawan et al., 2007) and classifier-based reordering model with linear features (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007a; Xiong et al., 2008).

1 Introduction Phrase-based method (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007) and syntaxbased method (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007c, 2008a, 2008b; Shen et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) represent the state-of-the-art technologies in statistical machine translation (SMT).

2.3 Hierarchical Machine Translation HPB translation system is a re-implementation of the hierarchical phrase translation model which is based on PSCFG (Chiang, 2005).

Title:N09-1029		Conference:HLT-NAACL		Author:Chen, Han-Bin; Wu, Jian-Cheng; Chang, Jason S.
In hierarchical phrase-based systems (Chiang, 2005), for example, SCFG rules are automatically learned from aligned bilingual corpus, and are applied in CKY style decoding.

Title:N09-1029		Conference:HLT-NAACL		Author:Chen, Han-Bin; Wu, Jian-Cheng; Chang, Jason S.
Each sequences of consecutive phrases, mapping to cells in a CKY matrix, are then translated through a bilingual phrase table and scored as implemented in (Koehn et al., 2005; Chiang, 2005).

Since the success of phrase-based methods (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn, 2004), models based on formal syntax (Chiang, 2005) or linguistic syntax (Liu et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006) have also achieved state-of-the-art performance.

1 Introduction Most recent approaches in SMT, eg (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005), use a log-linear model to combine probabilistic features.

Title:D09-1021		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Carreras, Xavier; Collins, Michael John
Early examples of this work include (Alshawi, 1996; Wu, 1997); more recent models include (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Chiang, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Nesson et al., 2006; Cherry, 2008; Mi et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2008).

Title:D09-1021		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Carreras, Xavier; Collins, Michael John
1 Introduction Syntax-based models for statistical machine translation (SMT) have recently shown impressive results; many such approaches are based on either synchronous grammars (e.g., (Chiang, 2005)), or tree transducers (e.g., (Marcu et al., 2006)).

Title:D09-1123		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Hassan, Hany; Sima'an, Khalil; Way, Andy
They use an existing parser to parse the target side of the parallel corpus in order to extract a syntactically motivated, bilingual synchronous grammar as in (Chiang, 2005).

Title:D09-1123		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Hassan, Hany; Sima'an, Khalil; Way, Andy
Likewise, the model in (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) extends (Chiang, 2005) by augmenting the hierarchical phrases with syntactic categories derived from parsing the target side of a parallel corpus.

Title:E09-1049		Conference:EACL		Author:Khalilov, Maxim; Fonollosa, Jos&eacute;; A. R.
The orthodox phrase-based model was enhanced in Chiang (2005), where a hierarchical phrase model allowing for multiple generalizations within each phrase was introduced.

Title:E09-1049		Conference:EACL		Author:Khalilov, Maxim; Fonollosa, Jos&eacute;; A. R.
The rule recursive generalization procedure coincides with the one proposed in Chiang (2005), but violates the restrictions introduced for singlecategory grammar; for example, rules that contain adjacent generalized elements are not discarded.

Title:E09-1049		Conference:EACL		Author:Khalilov, Maxim; Fonollosa, Jos&eacute;; A. R.
This problem was successfully addressed when the MT system based on generalized hierarchically structured phrases was introduced and discussed in Chiang (2005).

1 Introduction Phrase-based systems, flat and hierarchical alike (Koehn et al., 2003; Koehn, 2004b; Koehn et al., 2007; Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), have achieved a much better translation coverage than wordbased ones (Brown et al., 1993), but untranslated words remain a major problem in SMT.

(2006) follow Chiang (2005) in disallowing adjacent nonterminals.

Title:J09-4009		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Huang, Liang; Zhang, Hao; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
Introduction Several recent syntax-based models for machine translation (Chiang 2005; Galley et al. 2004) can be seen as instances of the general framework of synchronous grammars and tree transducers.

Title:J09-4009		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Huang, Liang; Zhang, Hao; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
One way around this difficulty is to stipulate that all rules must be binary from the outset, as in Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) (Wu 1997) and the binary SCFG employed by the Hiero system (Chiang 2005) to model the hierarchical phrases.

Title:J09-4009		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Huang, Liang; Zhang, Hao; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
However, in the source-channel approach to machine translation, we need to combine probabilities from the translation model (TM) (an SCFG) with the language model (an n-gram), which has been shown to be very important for translation quality (Chiang 2005).

Title:J09-4009		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Huang, Liang; Zhang, Hao; Gildea, Daniel; Knight, Kevin
As illustrated in Figure 2, PP-VP has contiguous spans on both sourceand target-sides, so that we can generate a binary-branching SCFG: (4) S ! NP 1 PP-VP 2 , NP 1 PP-VP 2 PP-VP ! VP 1 PP 2 , PP 2 VP 1 In this case m-gram integrated decoding can be done in O(jwj3+4(m1)) time, which is a much lower-order polynomial and no longer depends on rule size (Wu 1996), allowing the search to be much faster and more accurate, as is evidenced in the Hiero system of Chiang (2005), which restricts the hierarchical phrases to form binary-branching SCFG rules.

Title:E09-1044		Conference:EACL		Author:Iglesias, Gonzalo; Gispert, Adri&agrave;; de; Banga, Eduardo R.; Byrne, William
Marton and Resnik (2008) exploit shallow correspondences of hierarchical rules with source syntactic constituents extracted from parallel text, an approach also investigated by Chiang (2005).

3.1 Building the Rule Sets We extract hierarchical phrases from word alignments, applying the same restrictions as introduced by Chiang (2005).

Cube pruning is used to apply language models at each cell of the CYK grid as part of the search for a k-best list of translation candidates (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).

Title:N09-1027		Conference:HLT-NAACL		Author:Venugopal, Ashish; Zollmann, Andreas; Smith, Noah A.; Vogel, Stephan
Our model falls somewhere between PSCFGs that extract nonterminal symbols from parse trees and treat them as part of 236 the derivation (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) and unlabeled hierarchical structures (Chiang, 2005); we treat nonterminal labels as random variables chosen at each node, with each (unlabeled) rule expressing preferences for particular nonterminal labels, learned from data.

Title:N09-1027		Conference:HLT-NAACL		Author:Venugopal, Ashish; Zollmann, Andreas; Smith, Noah A.; Vogel, Stephan
In this work, we define N ={S,X} H={NP,DT,NN}=NSAMT where N corresponds to the generic labels of Chiang (2005) and H corresponds to the syntactically motivated SAMT labels from (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), and pi maps all elements of H to X. We will use hargs(r) to denote the set of all vectorh =h0,h1,,hkHk+1 that are valid bindings for the rule with nonzero preference probability.

Title:N09-1027		Conference:HLT-NAACL		Author:Venugopal, Ashish; Zollmann, Andreas; Smith, Noah A.; Vogel, Stephan
The system Hier. uses a grammar with a single nonterminal label as in Chiang (2005).

Title:N09-1027		Conference:HLT-NAACL		Author:Venugopal, Ashish; Zollmann, Andreas; Smith, Noah A.; Vogel, Stephan
In this work we address the increased fragmentation resulting from rules with labeled nonterminals compared to unlabeled rules (Chiang, 2005).

Each hiH. When N,H are defined to include just a single generic symbol as in (Chiang, 2005), we produce the unlabeled grammar discussed above.

The translation of the Chinese word sequence ( m can be performed by expanding the nonterminal in the rule a place where I can X1 with either eat or dish. A hierarchical system (Chiang, 2005) would allow either expansion, relying on features like pLM to select the best translation since both expansions occurred the same number of times in the data.

Recent research in syntax based machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) incorporates syntactic information to ameliorate the reordering problem faced by PB-SMT approaches.

Title:W09-1908		Conference:Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2009 Workshop on Active Learning for Natural Language Processing		Author:Ambati, Vamshi; Carbonnell, Jaime G.
While traditional approaches to syntax based MT were dependent on availability of manual grammar, more recent approaches operate within the resources of PB-SMT and induce hierarchical or linguistic grammars from existing phrasal units, to provide better generality and structure for reordering (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005; Wu, 1997).

Title:P09-1066		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Li, Mu; Duan, Nan; Zhang, Dongdong; Li, Chi-Ho; Zhou, Ming
This step seems to be redundant for CKY-style MT decoders (Liu et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Chiang, 2005) since the grouping is immediately available from decoders because all hypotheses spanning the same range of source sentence have been stacked together in the same chart cell.

1 Introduction In statistical machine translation (SMT) community, the state-of-the-art method is to use rules that contain hierarchical structures to model translation, such as the hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P09-2031		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP: Short Papers		Author:He, Zhongjun; Meng, Yao; L&uuml;, Yajuan; Yu, Hao; Liu, Qun
Note that the first 3 settings are used in (Chiang, 2005) for rule extraction.

Title:P09-2031		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP: Short Papers		Author:He, Zhongjun; Meng, Yao; L&uuml;, Yajuan; Yu, Hao; Liu, Qun
This step is analogous to the rule extraction as described in (Chiang, 2005).

rewriting, up to some bounded degree, and have recently been exploited, in some syntactic variant, in syntax-based machine translation (Chiang, 2005; Melamed, 2003) as well as in the modeling of syntax-semantic interface (Nesson and Shieber, 2006).

Title:W09-0809		Conference:Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages		Author:Elming, Jakob; Habash, Nizar
Separating the scoring from the source language reordering also has the advantage that the approach in essence is compatible with other approaches such as a traditional PSMT system (Koehn et al., 2003b) or a hierarchical phrase system (Chiang, 2005).

Title:W09-0809		Conference:Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages		Author:Elming, Jakob; Habash, Nizar
We are also interested in examining the approach within a standard phrase-based decoder such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2003b) or a hierarchical phrase system (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P09-1065		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Liu, Yang; Mi, Haitao; Feng, Yang; Liu, Qun
first model was the hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).

For example, Figure 1 shows a sequence of SCFG rules (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) that translates a Chinese sentence fabiao yanjiang into an English sentence give a talk.

We evaluated our joint decoder that integrated a hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) and a tree-to-string model (Liu et al., 2006) on the NIST 2005 Chinese-English testset.

1 Introduction A statistical phrasal (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) or hierarchical (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006) machine translation system usually relies on a very large set of translation rules extracted from bi-lingual training data with heuristic methods on word alignment results.

3.1 Context Features In the hierarchical phrase-based translation method, the translation rules are extracted by abstracting some words from an initial phrase pair (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P10-1086		Conference:ACL		Author:Chen, Boxing; Foster, George; Kuhn, Roland
Following (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), 4 features are computed for each rule: )|( P and )|( P are direct and inverse rule-based conditional probabilities; )|( wP and )|( wP are direct and inverse lexical weights (Koehn et al., 2003).

2 Hierarchical phrase-based MT system The hierarchical phrase-based translation method (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) is a formal syntaxbased translation modeling method; its translation model is a weighted synchronous context free grammar (SCFG).

Title:P10-1086		Conference:ACL		Author:Chen, Boxing; Foster, George; Kuhn, Roland
Empirically, this method has yielded better performance on language pairs such as ChineseEnglish than the phrase-based method because it permits phrases with gaps; it generalizes the normal phrase-based models in a way that allows long-distance reordering (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).

CFSM is the probability of source-side rule selection that can be estimated based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method: Ps() = summationtext Count(,) Count() (3) where the numerator is the total count of bilingual rule pairs with the same source-side rule that are extracted based on the extraction algorithm in (Chiang, 2005), and the denominator is the total amount of source-side rule patterns contained in the monolingual source side of the training corpus.

Although SCFGS were initially introduced for machine translation as a stochastic word-based translation process in the form of the InversionTransduction Grammar (Wu, 1997), they were actually able to offer state-of-the-art performance in their latter phrase-based implementation by Chiang (Chiang, 2005).

To overcome this problem and certain dependency problems, Shieber and Schabes (1990) and Shieber (2007) suggest a stronger model called synchronous tree-adjoining grammar (STAG), which in addition to the substitution operation of STSG (Chiang, 2005) also has an adjoining operation.

Many SMT frameworks have been developed, including phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Chiang, 2005), syntax-based SMT (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2006; Cowan et al., 2006), etc. With the emergence of various structurally different SMT systems, more and more studies are focused on combining multiple SMT systems for achieving higher translation accuracy rather than using a single translation system.

In this system all phrase pairs are limited to have source length of at most 3, and the reordering limit is set to 8 by default 4 . The second SMT system is an in-house reimplementation of the Hiero system which is based on the hierarchical phrase-based model proposed by Chiang (2005).

1 Introduction Both PBMT models (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005) and syntax-based machine translation models (Yamada et al., 2000; Quirk et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; and numerous others) are the state-of-theart statistical machine translation (SMT) methods.

Furthermore, currentSMTsystems,eitherphrase-based(Koehnetal., 2003; Chiang, 2005) or syntax-based (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), use phrases as the fundamental translation unit, so how much the phrase table and training data can cover the test set is an important factor which influences the translation quality.

1 Introduction The hierarchial phrase-based (HPB) model (Chiang, 2005) outperformed previous phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) by utilizing hierarchical phrases consisting of both words and variables.

Title:P10-1146		Conference:ACL		Author:Chiang, David
We therefore propose to move these constraints from the formalism into the model, implemented as features in the hierarchical phrasebased model Hiero (Chiang, 2005). (self citation)

Title:P10-1146		Conference:ACL		Author:Chiang, David
The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005) make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006). (self citation)

Title:P10-1146		Conference:ACL		Author:Chiang, David
All systems used the glue rule (Chiang, 2005), which allows the decoder, working bottom-up, to stop building hierarchical structure and instead concatenate partial translations without any reordering. (self citation)

The tree c[t] is obtained from c by replacing the symbol square by t. A weighted synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) is a system (N,,,I,P) where N is an alphabet of nonterminals, and are ranked alphabets of input and output symbols, respectively, I: NR assigns initial weights, and P is a finite set of productions n: t au with nN, tT(N), aR, and uT(N) such that every nprime N that occurs in t occurs exactly once in u and vice versa, and t /N or u /N. Note that our distinction between nonterminals and terminals is rather uncommon for STSG [see Chiang (2005)], but improves the generative power.

1 Introduction Syntax based approaches for Machine Translation (MT) have gained popularity in recent times because of their ability to handle long distance reorderings (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2002; Quirk et al., 2005; Chiang, 2005), especially for divergent language pairs such as English-Hindi (or English-Urdu).

Title:W10-3809		Conference:Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation		Author:Venkatapathy, Sriram; Sangal, Rajeev; Joshi, Aravind K.; Gali, Karthik
Some of the limitations with the syntax based approaches such as (Yamada and Knight, 2002; Quirk et al., 2005; Chiang, 2005) are, (1) They do not offer flexibility for adding linguistically motivated features, and (2) It is not possible to use morphological factors in the syntax based approaches.

Our models improve translation quality over the single generic label approach of Chiang (2005) and perform on par with the syntactically motivated approach from Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) on the NIST large Chineseto-English translation task.

Title:P11-1001		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Zollmann, Andreas; Vogel, Stephan
Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) directly extend the rule extraction procedure from Chiang (2005) to heuristically label any phrase pair based on target language parse trees.

Several techniques have been recently proposed to automatically identify and estimate parameters for PSCFGs (or related synchronous grammars) from parallel corpora (Galley et al., 2004; Chiang, 2005; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006).

Title:P11-1001		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Zollmann, Andreas; Vogel, Stephan
Evaluated on a Chinese-to-English translation task, our approach improves translation quality over a popular PSCFG baselinethe hierarchical model of Chiang (2005) and performs on par with the model of Zollmann and Venugopal (2006), using heuristically generated labels from parse trees.

Unsupervised synchronous grammar induction, apart from the contribution of Chiang (2005) discussed earlier, has been proposed by Wu (1997) for inversion transduction grammars, but as Chiangs model only uses a single generic nonterminal label.

Title:P11-1001		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Zollmann, Andreas; Vogel, Stephan
PSCFGs are defined by a source terminal set (source vocabulary) TS, a target terminal set (target vocabulary)TT, a shared nonterminal set N and rules of the form: A,,wwhere AN is a labeled nonterminal referred to as the left-hand-side of the rule, (NTS) is the source side of the rule, (NTT) is the target side of the rule, w [0,) is a non-negative real-valued weight assigned to the rule; in our model,wis the product of features i raised to the power of weight i. Chiang (2005) learns a single-nonterminal PSCFG from a bilingual corpus by first identifying initial phrase pairs using the technique from Koehn et al.

We include comparisons of our work against the Hiero system (Chiang, 2005), the Stat-XFER system rule learner most recently described by Ambati et al.

Title:W11-1015		Conference:Proceedings of Fifth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation		Author:Hanneman, Greg; Burroughs, Michelle; Lavie, Alon
Some SCFG rule extraction techniques require only Viterbi word alignment links between the source and target sides of the input corpus (Chiang, 2005), while methods based on linguistic constituency structure require the source and/or target side of the input to be parsed.

Title:P11-2072		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Chung, Tagyoung; Fang, Licheng; Gildea, Daniel
Hiero (Chiang, 2005) represents a more restricted form of SCFG, while GHKM (Galley et al., 2004) uses a general form of SCFG.

Title:P11-2072		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Chung, Tagyoung; Fang, Licheng; Gildea, Daniel
Therefore, we may opt to add glue rules as used in Hiero (Chiang, 2005): S null C, C S null S C, S C where S is the goal state and C is the glue nonterminal that can produce any nonterminals.

While several significantly improved models have been developed since then, including phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical (Chiang, 2005), treelet (Quirk et al., 2005), and syntactic (Galley et al., 2004) models, they all preserved the assumption that words should be atomic.

In addition to the gappy phrase-based (Simard et al., 2005) and hierarchical phrase-based (Chiang, 2005) models mentioned earlier, other researchers have explored the use of bilingual gappy structures for machine translation.

Smith Language Technologies Institute Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA {kgimpel,nasmith}@cs.cmu.edu Abstract A growing body of machine translation research aims to exploit lexical patterns (e.g., ngrams and phrase pairs) with gaps (Simard et al., 2005; Chiang, 2005; Xiong et al., 2011).

Title:W11-2165		Conference:Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Gimpel, Kevin; Smith, Noah A.
The widely-used hierarchical phrase-based translation framework was introduced by Chiang (2005) and also relies on a simple heuristic for phrase pair extraction.

In order to further improve the reordering performance, many structure-based methods are proposed, including the reordering model in hierarchical phrase-based SMT systems (Chiang, 2005) and syntax-based SMT systems (Zhang et al., 2007; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Ge, 2010; Visweswariah et al., 2010).

3.3 Integrated into SMT system The SMT systems generally employ the log-linear model to integrate various features (Chiang, 2005; Koehn et al., 2007).

Title:P11-1104		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Liu, Zhanyi; Wang, Haifeng; Wu, Hua; Liu, Ting; Li, Sheng
Hierarchical phrasebased SMT methods employ SCFG bilingual translation model and allow flexible reordering (Chiang, 2005).

Title:P11-1003		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Wu, Xianchao; Matsuzaki, Takuya; Tsujii, Jun'ichi
Thus, flat phrases (Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical phrases (Chiang, 2005), and syntactic tree fragments (Galley et al., 2006; Mi and Huang, 2008; Wu et al., 2010) are gradually used in SMT.

Title:P11-1003		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Wu, Xianchao; Matsuzaki, Takuya; Tsujii, Jun'ichi
Joshua v1.3 (Li et al., 2009), which is a freely available decoder for hierarchical phrasebased SMT (Chiang, 2005), is used as an external baseline system for comparison.

Title:D11-1020		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Xie, Jun; Mi, Haitao; Liu, Qun
This model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hierarchical phrasebased model (Chiang, 2005).

Title:D11-1020		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Xie, Jun; Mi, Haitao; Liu, Qun
The hierarchical phrase-based model prohibits any nonterminal X from spanning a substring longer than 10 on the source side to make the decoding algorithm asymptotically linear-time (Chiang, 2005).

Title:W11-1009		Conference:Proceedings of Fifth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation		Author:Attardi, Giuseppe; Chanev, Atanas; Miceli Barone, Antonio Valerio
Many similar approaches are based on constituent grammars, among which we mention (Chiang, 2005) who introduced hierarchical translation models.

The HR-SCFG we adopt allows capturing more complex reordering phenomena and, in contrast to both (Chiang, 2005; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), is not exposed to the issues highlighted in section 2.1.

2 Joint Translation Model Our model is based on a probabilistic Synchronous CFG (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005).

The Hiero system (Chiang, 2005) utilised an ITG-flavour which focused on hierarchicalphrase-pairstocapturecontext-driventranslation and reordering patterns with gaps, offering competitive performance particularly for language pairs with extensive reordering.

We compare against a state-of-the-art hierarchical translation (Chiang, 2005) baseline, based on the Joshua translation system under the default training anddecodingsettings(josh-base).

Title:D11-1044		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Gimpel, Kevin; Smith, Noah A.
(2008) presented an extension to Hiero (Chiang, 2005) in which rules have target-side dependency syntax and therefore enable the use of a dependency language model.

Title:D11-1044		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Gimpel, Kevin; Smith, Noah A.
Models that employ syntax or syntaxlike representations (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Huang et al., 2006) handle long-distance reordering better than phrase-based systems (Auli et al., 2009) but often require constraints on the formalism or rule extraction method in order to achieve computational tractability.

Title:D11-1044		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Gimpel, Kevin; Smith, Noah A.
The conventional wisdom holds that hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005) performs better than phrasebased translation for language pairs that require large amounts of reordering, such as ZH-EN and UR-EN.

5 Experiments Setup We tested these features on two machine translation systems: a hierarchical phrasebased (string-to-string) system (Chiang, 2005) and a syntax-based (string-to-tree) system (Galley et al., 2004;Galley et al.,2006).For Arabic-English translation, both systems were trained on 190+220 million words of parallel data;for Chinese-English,the string-to-string system was trained on 240+260million words of parallel data,and the string-to-tree system, 58+65 million words.

Finally, we ap201 ply our language models to the task of re-ranking the N-best list from Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), a state-of-the-art parsing-based MT system, we achieve significantly better translation quality measured by the BLEU score and readability.

Title:P11-1021		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Tan, Ming; Zhou, Wenli; Zheng, Lei; Wang, Shaojun
This list was generated on 919 sentences from the MT03 Chinese-English evaluation set by Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), a state-of-the-art parsing-based translation model.

Title:P11-1021		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Tan, Ming; Zhou, Wenli; Zheng, Lei; Wang, Shaojun
It is expected that putting the our composite language into a one pass decoder of both phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003) and parsing-based (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) MT systems should result in much improved BLEU scores.

These include sentence alignment (Gale and Church, 1993; Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003), word alignment and noisy channel decoding (Brown et al., 1990; Quirk et al., 2004), phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), hierarchical phrase-based models (Chiang, 2005; Madnani et al., 2007), log-linear models and minimum error rate training (Och, 2003a; Madnani et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2008a), and here syntaxbased machine translation (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Melamed, 2004; Quirk et al., 2005).

These phrase extraction heuristics have been extended so that they extract synchronous grammar rules (Galley et al., 2004; Chiang, 2005; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Liu et al., 2006).

Title:D11-1108		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Ganitkevitch, Juri; Callison-Burch, Chris; Napoles, Courtney; van Durme, Benjamin
(2007) extended the technique to hierarchical phrase-based machine translation (Chiang, 2005), which is formally a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) and thus can be thought of as a paraphrase grammar.

3 Our Approach: Phrase-Based Translation Model for Question Retrieval 3.1 Phrase-Based Translation Model Phrase-based machine translation models (Koehn et al., 2003; D. Chiang, 2005; Och and Ney, 2004) have shown superior performance compared to word-based translation models.

Around the middle of the last decade, two extraction paradigms were proposed for syntax-based machine translation: the Hiero paradigm of (Chiang, 2005) and the GHKM paradigm of (Galley et al., 2004).

Title:P11-1124		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Ma, Yanjun; He, Yifan; Way, Andy; van Genabith, Josef
Currently, only a standard phrase-based SMT system is used, so we plan to test our method on a hierarchical system (Chiang, 2005) to facilitate direct comparison with (Koehn and Senellart, 2010).

Title:P11-1124		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Ma, Yanjun; He, Yifan; Way, Andy; van Genabith, Josef
For example, (Koehn and Senellart, 2010) showed that reusing these translations as large rules in a hierarchical system (Chiang, 2005) can be beneficial when the fuzzy match score is above 70%, while (Zhechev and van Genabith, 2010) reported that it is only beneficial to a phrase-based system when the fuzzy match score is above 90%.

Title:D11-1149		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Lu, Wei; Ng, Hwee Tou
Following popular approaches to learning feature weights in the machine translation community (Och and Ney, 2004; Chiang, 2005), we use the minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) algorithm to learn the feature weights that directly optimize certain automatic evaluation metric.

Title:D11-1149		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Lu, Wei; Ng, Hwee Tou
Current state-of-theart string-based translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005; Galley and Manning, 2010) typically begin with a word-aligned corpus to construct phrasal correspondences.

Title:D11-1149		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Lu, Wei; Ng, Hwee Tou
We thus compare our system against two stateof-the-art machine translation systems: a phrasebased translation system, implemented in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007)6, and a hierarchical phrase-based translation system, implemented in the Joshua toolkit (Li et al., 2009), which is a reimplementation of the original Hiero system (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).

In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005) a weighted synchronous context-free grammar is induced from parallel text, the search is based on CYK+ parsing (Chappelier and Rajman, 1998) and typically carried out using the cube pruning algorithm (Huang and Chiang, 2007).

1 Hierarchical phrase-based translation has been pioneered by David Chiang (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) with his Hiero system.

3 Background: Hypergraphs Translation with many syntax-based systems (e.g., (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008; Huang and Mi, 2010)) can be implemented as a two-step process.

Title:P11-1008		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Rush, Alexander M.; Collins, Michael John
The decoding problem for a broad range of these systems (e.g., (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008)) corresponds to the intersection of a (weighted) hypergraph with an n-gram language model.1 The hypergraph represents a large set of possible translations, and is created by applying a synchronous grammar to the source language string.

Title:P11-1008		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Rush, Alexander M.; Collins, Michael John
For example, in the system of (Chiang, 2005), the hypergraph is created as follows: first, the source side of the synchronous grammar is used to create a parse forest over the source language string.

1 Introduction Besides tremendous efforts on constructing more complicated and accurate models for statistical machine translation (SMT) (Och and Ney, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008; Chiang 2010), many researchers have concentrated on the approaches that improve translation quality using information between hypotheses from one or more SMT systems as well.

It includes hierarchical rules extracted using Chiang (2005)s method and glue rules.

The first one is based on BTG (Wu, 1997), and the second one is based on SCFG, similar to Chiang (2005).

Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) augment the hierarchical string-to-string rules (Chiang, 2005) with target-side syntax.

Title:D11-1079		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Gao, Yang; Koehn, Philipp; Birch, Alexandra
To discourage nonconstituent translation, Chiang (2005) has proposed a constituency feature to examine whether a source rule span matches the source constituent as defined by phrase structure parsing.

Title:D11-1079		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Gao, Yang; Koehn, Philipp; Birch, Alexandra
For example, constituency constraints in (Chiang, 2005; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Chiang et al., 2009) would penalize Rule 7 below which is useful for GermanEnglish translation (Koehn et al., 2003), and Rule 8 which can be applied to the Figure 1 sentence.

620 statistical MT that can run in linear-time (4) Integration with Moses (5) along with empirical results for perplexity and significant translation score improvement on a constrained UrduEnglish task (6) 2 Related Work Neither phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003) nor hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005) take explicit advantage of the syntactic structure of either source or target language.

Title:W11-2143		Conference:Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation		Author:Hanneman, Greg; Lavie, Alon
Although we found mixed results in their application within our current system, the success of Hiero-derived MT systems (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2010) shows that high translation quality can be achieved with rules that are only partially abstract.

In this work, we investigate the effect of MERT using BLEU, TER, and two variants of TESLA, TESLA-M and TESLA-F, on Joshua (Li et al., 2009), a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based SMT system (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).
