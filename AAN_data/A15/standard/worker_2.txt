To discourage nonconstituent translation, Chiang (2005) has proposed a constituency feature to examine whether a source rule span matches the source constituent as defined by phrase structure parsing
Chiang (2005) introduced a constituent feature to reward phrases that match a syntactic tree but did not yield significant improvement
In addtion to the standard features used in Chiang (2005), we also used a lexicon feature indicating how many word paris in the translation found in a conventional Chinese-English lexicon
The model of Chiang (2005) employs a synchronous context-free grammar to allow hierarchical approaches to reordering
1 Introduction Recently Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems based on Synchronous Context Free Grammar (SCFG) have been extensively investigated (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al
They use an existing parser to parse the target side of the parallel corpus in order to extract a syntactically motivated, bilingual synchronous grammar as in (Chiang, 2005)
More recently, (Chiang, 2005) extended phrase-pairs (or blocks) to hierarchical phrase-pairs where a grammar with a single non-terminal allows the embedding of phrases-pairs, to allow for arbitrary embedding and capture global reordering though this approach still has the high overlap problem
In hierarchical phrase-based systems (Chiang, 2005), for example, SCFG rules are automatically learned from aligned bilingual corpus, and are applied in CKY style decoding
Thus similar to Chiang (2005), U-DOP can discover non-syntactic phrases, or simply phrases, which are typically neglected by linguistically syntax-based MT systems
With the emergence of various structurally different SMT systems, more and more studies are focused on combining multiple SMT systems for achieving higher translation accuracy rather than using a single translation system
1 Context Features In the hierarchical phrase-based translation method, the translation rules are extracted by abstracting some words from an initial phrase pair (Chiang, 2005)
Chiang (2005) has recently shown significant improvements in translation accuracy, using synchronous grammars
2 Hierarchical translation Hierarchical systems (Chiang, 2005) induce a context-free grammar with one non-terminal directly from the parallel corpus, with the advantage of not requiring any additional knowledge source or tools, such as a treebank or a parser
Following the Data-Oriented Parsing inspired rule generalization technique proposed by Chiang (2005), one can now generalize each identified rule (initial or already partially generalized) N ??
The most common algorithm for decoding with SCFG is currently CKY+ with cube pruning works for both hierarchical and syntactic systems, as implemented in Hiero (Chiang, 2005), Joshua (Li et al
