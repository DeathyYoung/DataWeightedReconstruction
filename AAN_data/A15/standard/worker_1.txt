The model of Chiang (2005) employs a synchronous context-free grammar to allow hierarchical approaches to reordering
2 Parsing word lattices Chiang (2005) introduced hierarchical phrase-based translation models, which are formally based on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs)
In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005) a weighted synchronous context-free grammar is induced from parallel text, the search is based on CYK+ parsing (Chappelier and Rajman, 1998) and typically carried out using the cube pruning algorithm (Huang and Chiang, 2007)
The benefit of introducing lexical evidence without being fully lexicalized has been demonstrated by a recent state-of-the-art formally syntax-based model1, Hiero (Chiang, 2005)
To discourage nonconstituent translation, Chiang (2005) has proposed a constituency feature to examine whether a source rule span matches the source constituent as defined by phrase structure parsing
Synchronous parsing has seen a surge of interest recently in the machine translation community as a way of formalizing syntax-based translation models (Melamed, 2004; Chiang, 2005)
1A notable exception to this kind of approach is Chiang (2005) who introduces syntactic information into phrase-based SMT via hierarchical phrases rather than by external parsing
Recent research in syntax based machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) incorporates syntactic information to ameliorate the reordering problem faced by PB-SMT approaches
It has been used in syntax-based SMT to model the translation of one NL to another (Chiang, 2005)
Thus it can be seen asa shift to the formal machinery of syntax-based translation systems without any lin-guistic commitment
Chiang (2005) shows significant improvement by keeping the strengths of phrases while incorporating syntax into statistical translation
While (Chiang, 2005) uses only two nonterminal symbols in his grammar, we introduce multiple syntactic categories, taking advantage of a target language parser for this information
Analogous techniques for tree-structured translation models involve either allowing each nonterminal to generate both terminals and other nonterminals (Groves et al
We present a statistical phrase-based transla-tion model that uses hierarchical phrases?phrases that contain subphrases
The modelis formally a synchronous context-free gram-mar but is learned from a bitext without anysyntactic information
