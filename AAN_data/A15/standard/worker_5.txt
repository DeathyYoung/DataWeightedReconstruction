Chiang (2005) introduced a constituent feature to reward phrases that match a syntactic tree but did not yield significant improvement
A hierarchical phrase-based translation model (HPTM) reorganizes phrases into hierarchical ones by reducing sub-phrases to variables (Chiang 2005)
The model of Chiang (2005) employs a synchronous context-free grammar to allow hierarchical approaches to reordering
Phrase-based rules have also been replaced with synchronous context free grammars (Chiang, 2005) and with tree fragments (Huang and Knight, 2006)
Marton and Resnik (2008) introduced features defined on constituent labels to improve the Hiero system (Chiang, 2005)
, 2006) machine translation system usually relies on a very large set of translation rules extracted from bi-lingual training data with heuristic methods on word alignment results
Marton and Resnik (2008) exploit shallow correspondences of hierarchical rules with source syntactic constituents extracted from parallel text, an approach also investigated by Chiang (2005)
Introduction Hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang 2005) is one of the current promising approaches to statistical machine translation (SMT)
Chiang (2005) introduced a hierarchical phrasebased translation model that combined the strength of the phrase-based approach and a synchronous-CFG formalism (Aho and Ullman, 1969): A rewrite system initiated from a start symbol which synchronously rewrites paired nonterminals
In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005) a weighted synchronous context-free grammar is induced from parallel text, the search is based on CYK+ parsing (Chappelier and Rajman, 1998) and typically carried out using the cube pruning algorithm (Huang and Chiang, 2007)
The hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005) used hierarchical phrase pairs to strengthen the generalization ability of phrases and allow long distance reorderings
Additionally, we incorporate the pruning techniques used in (Chiang 2005), by which any hypothesis with a probability lower thantimes the highest probability for one sentence is discarded
2 Hierarchical translation Hierarchical systems (Chiang, 2005) induce a context-free grammar with one non-terminal directly from the parallel corpus, with the advantage of not requiring any additional knowledge source or tools, such as a treebank or a parser
The most common algorithm for decoding with SCFG is currently CKY+ with cube pruning works for both hierarchical and syntactic systems, as implemented in Hiero (Chiang, 2005), Joshua (Li et al
More recent work handles word order differences between source and target languages using hierarchical methods that draw on Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG), e
