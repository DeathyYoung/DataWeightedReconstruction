Sentence simplification systems (Chandrasekar et al. , 1996; Mahesh, 1997; Carroll et al. , 1998; Grefenstette, 1998; Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2000) are capable of compressing long sentences by deleting unimportant words and phrases.

Title:J02-4005		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Saggion, Horacio; Lapalme, Guy
Jing and McKeown (2000) and Jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences.

Title:J02-4005		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Saggion, Horacio; Lapalme, Guy
Jing (2000) proposes a novel algorithm for sentence reduction that takes into account different sources of information to decide whether or not to remove a particular component from a sentence to be included in a summary.

Title:W03-1119		Conference:International Workshop On Information Retrieval With Asian Languages		Author:Nguyen, Minh Le; Horiguchi, Susumu
Jing and McKeown(H. Jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed.

Title:W03-1101		Conference:International Workshop On Information Retrieval With Asian Languages		Author:Lin, Chin-Yew
For example, Jing (2000) trained her system on a set of 500 sentences from the Benton Foundation (http://www.benton.org) and their reduced forms written by humans.

Depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence headlines for multi-sentence text (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing, 2000).

Title:N03-1026		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Riezler, Stefan; King, Tracy Holloway; Crouch, Richard; Zaenen, Annie
To overcome this problem, linguistic parsing and generation systems are used in the sentence condensation approaches of Knight and Marcu (2000) and Jing (2000).

Title:N03-1026		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Riezler, Stefan; King, Tracy Holloway; Crouch, Richard; Zaenen, Annie
In addition, an automatic evaluation method based on context-free deletion decisions has been proposed by Jing (2000).

Between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Mahesh 1997; Carroll et al. 1998; Grefenstette 1998; Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002) and document compression (Daume III and Marcu 2002; Daume III and Marcu 2004; Zajic, Dorr, and Schwartz 2004) in which words, phrases, and sentences are selected in an extraction process.

Title:P06-2019		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Clarke, James; Lapata, Mirella
Examples include text summarisation (Jing 2000), subtitle generation from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan 2004) and information retrieval (Olivers and Dolan 1999).

Title:P06-2019		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Clarke, James; Lapata, Mirella
Our constraints are linguistically and semantically motivated in a similar fashion to the grammar checking component of Jing (2000).

Title:P06-2019		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Clarke, James; Lapata, Mirella
In contrast to Jing (2000), the bulk of the research on sentence compression relies exclusively on corpus data for modelling the compression process without recourse to extensive knowledge sources (e.g. , WordNet).

Title:P06-1048		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Clarke, James; Lapata, Mirella
Many algorithms exploit parallel corpora (Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002; Riezler et al. 2003; Nguyen et al. 2004a; Turner and Charniak 2005; McDonald 2006) to learn the correspondences between long and short sentences in a supervised manner, typically using a rich feature space induced from parse trees.

Given the need to ensure grammatical sentences, a number of researchers have used syntax-directed approaches that perform transformations on the output of syntactic parsers (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al. , 2003).

Title:P08-1035		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Nomoto, Tadashi
Our approach is broadly in line with prior work (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al., 2003; Riezler et al., 2003; Clarke and Lapata, 2006), in that we make use of some form of syntactic knowledge to constrain compressions we generate.

Title:C08-1018		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Cohn, Trevor; Lapata, Mirella
In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (Jing, 2000).

Title:C08-1018		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Cohn, Trevor; Lapata, Mirella
Examples include the generation of subtitles from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan, 2004), the display of text on small screens such as mobile phones or PDAs (Corston-Oliver, 2001), and, notably, summarisation (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003).

Considerations of sentence fluency are also key in sentence simplification (Siddharthan, 2003), sentence compression (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; Clarke and Lapata, 2006; McDonald, 2006; Turner and Charniak, 2005; Galley and McKeown, 2007), text re-generation for summarization (Daume III and Marcu, 2004; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Wan et al., 2005) and headline generation (Banko et al., 2000; Zajic et al., 2007; Soricut and Marcu, 2007).

1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a single given sentence, so that the new form is grammatical and retains the most important information of the original one (Jing, 2000).

Title:N10-1131		Conference:Human Language Technologies: The 2010 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics		Author:Galanis, Dimitrios; Androutsopoulos, Ion
Most of the existing compression methods are extractive (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009).

Title:J10-3005		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Clarke, James; Lapata, Mirella
Jing (2000) uses information from the local context as evidence for and against the removal of phrases during sentence compression.

Title:D10-1050		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Woodsend, Kristian; Feng, Yansong; Lapata, Mirella
The conciseness can be improved when sentence extraction is interfaced with sentence compression, where words and clauses are deleted based on rules typically operating over parsed input (Jing, 2000; Daume III and Marcu, 2002; Lin, 2003; Daume III, 2006; Zajic et al., 2007; Martins and Smith, 2009).

Title:P10-1058		Conference:ACL		Author:Woodsend, Kristian; Lapata, Mirella
Interfacing extractive summarization with a sentence compression module could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries and render them more informative (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003; Zajic et al., 2007).

Title:N10-1044		Conference:Human Language Technologies: The 2010 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics		Author:McKeown, Kathleen R.; Rosenthal, Sara; Thadani, Kapil; Moore, Coleman
Furthermore, since research in the related task of sentence compression has benefited from the availability of training data (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2008), we expect that the creation of this corpus might encourage the development of supervised learning techniques for automated sentence fusion.

A syntactic approach considers the alignment over parse trees (Jing, 2000), and a similar technique has been used with dependency trees to evaluate the quality of sentence fusions (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005).

1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a grammatical source (input) sentence, so that the new form will still be grammatical and it will retain the most important information of the source (Jing, 2000).

Title:W11-2701		Conference:Proceedings of the UCNLG+Eval: Language Generation and Evaluation Workshop		Author:Galanis, Dimitrios; Androutsopoulos, Ion
Extractive methods are generally simpler and have dominated the sentence compression literature (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Nomoto, 2009; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010; Yamangil and Shieber, 2010).
