2004a; Turner and Charniak 2005; McDonald 2006) to learn the correspondences between long and short sentences in a supervised manner, typically using a rich feature space induced from parse trees
Examples include text summarisation (Jing 2000), subtitle generation from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan 2004) and information retrieval (Olivers and Dolan 1999)
Interfacing extractive summarization with a sentence compression module could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries and render them more informative (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003; Zajic et al
Given the need to ensure grammatical sentences, a number of researchers have used syntax-directed approaches that perform transformations on the output of syntactic parsers (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al
Jing and McKeown (2000) and Jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences
Considerations of sentence fluency are also key in sentence simplification (Siddharthan, 2003), sentence compression (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; Clarke and Lapata, 2006; McDonald, 2006; Turner and Charniak, 2005; Galley and McKeown, 2007), text re-generation for summarization (Daume III and Marcu, 2004; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Wan et al
J05-4004:18 Between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Mahesh 1997; Carroll et al 1998; Grefenstette 1998; Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002) and document compression (Daume III and Marcu 2002; Daume III and Marcu 2004; Zajic, Dorr, and Schwartz 2004) in which words, phrases, and sentences are selected in an extraction process
The evaluation of sentence reduction (see (Jing, 2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and their reduced forms in human-written abstracts
edu  Abstract We present a novel sentence reduction system for automatically removing extraneous phrases from sentences that are extracted from a document for 
2 Sentence compression Sentence compression is the task of summarizing a sentence while retaining most of the informational content and remaining grammatical (Jing, 2000)
For example, Jing (2000) trained her system on a set of 500 sentences from the Benton Foundation (http://www
 Jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed
A syntactic approach considers the alignment over parse trees (Jing, 2000), and a similar technique has been used with dependency trees to evaluate the quality of sentence fusions (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005)
1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a grammatical source (input) sentence, so that the new form will still be grammatical and it will retain the most important information of the source (Jing, 2000)
