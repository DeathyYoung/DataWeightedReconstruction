Furthermore, since research in the related task of sentence compression has benefited from the availability of training data (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2008), we expect that the creation of this corpus might encourage the development of supervised learning techniques for automated sentence fusion
Given the need to ensure grammatical sentences, a number of researchers have used syntax-directed approaches that perform transformations on the output of syntactic parsers (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al
Depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence headlines for multi-sentence text (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing, 2000)
The evaluation of sentence reduction (see (Jing, 2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and their reduced forms in human-written abstracts
In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (Jing, 2000)
The conciseness can be improved when sentence extraction is interfaced with sentence compression, where words and clauses are deleted based on rules typically operating over parsed input (Jing, 2000; Daume III and Marcu, 2002; Lin, 2003; Daume III, 2006; Zajic et al
Between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Mahesh 1997; Carroll et al
Jing (2000) uses information from the local context as evidence for and against the removal of phrases during sentence compression
1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a single given sentence, so that the new form is grammatical and retains the most important information of the original one (Jing, 2000)
2004a; Turner and Charniak 2005; McDonald 2006) to learn the correspondences between long and short sentences in a supervised manner, typically using a rich feature space induced from parse trees
Examples include text summarisation (Jing 2000), subtitle generation from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan 2004) and information retrieval (Olivers and Dolan 1999)
Interfacing extractive summarization with a sentence compression module could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries and render them more informative (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003; Zajic et al
2 Sentence compression Sentence compression is the task of summarizing a sentence while retaining most of the informational content and remaining grammatical (Jing, 2000)
 Jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed
A syntactic approach considers the alignment over parse trees (Jing, 2000), and a similar technique has been used with dependency trees to evaluate the quality of sentence fusions (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005)
