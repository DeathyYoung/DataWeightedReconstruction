The evaluation of sentence reduction (see (Jing, 2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and their reduced forms in human-written abstracts
In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (Jing, 2000)
Jing and McKeown (2000) and Jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences
Jing (2000) uses information from the local context as evidence for and against the removal of phrases during sentence compression
Examples include text summarisation (Jing 2000), subtitle generation from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan 2004) and information retrieval (Olivers and Dolan 1999)
Interfacing extractive summarization with a sentence compression module could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries and render them more informative (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003; Zajic et al
A syntactic approach considers the alignment over parse trees (Jing, 2000), and a similar technique has been used with dependency trees to evaluate the quality of sentence fusions (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005)
2 Sentence compression Sentence compression is the task of summarizing a sentence while retaining most of the informational content and remaining grammatical (Jing, 2000)
2004a; Turner and Charniak 2005; McDonald 2006) to learn the correspondences between long and short sentences in a supervised manner, typically using a rich feature space induced from parse trees
Given the need to ensure grammatical sentences, a number of researchers have used syntax-directed approaches that perform transformations on the output of syntactic parsers (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al
The conciseness can be improved when sentence extraction is interfaced with sentence compression, where words and clauses are deleted based on rules typically operating over parsed input (Jing, 2000; Daume III and Marcu, 2002; Lin, 2003; Daume III, 2006; Zajic et al
edu  Abstract We present a novel sentence reduction system for automatically removing extraneous phrases from sentences that are extracted from a document for 
1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a grammatical source (input) sentence, so that the new form will still be grammatical and it will retain the most important information of the source (Jing, 2000)
 Jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed
Many algorithms exploit parallel corpora (Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002; Riezler et al
