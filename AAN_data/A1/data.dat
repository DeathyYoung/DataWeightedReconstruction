We present an unsupervised method for detecting grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from edited textual corpora. The system was developed and tested using essay-length responses to prompts on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The error- recognition system, ALEK, performs with about 80% precision and 20% recall.

Finally, mirroring noteworthy progress in other NLP fields involving data-driven methods, recent work has involved essay grading via exemplar-based machine learning techniques (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000)

However, a drawback to it is that there are differences in character between general corpora and the writing of non-native learners of English (Granger, 1998; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000).

Title:P06-1031		Conference:Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Ryo Nagata (Hyogo University of Teacher Education, Hyogo Japan);Atsuo Kawai (Mie University, Mie Japan);Koichiro Morihiro;Naoki Isu
For instance, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) point out that the word concentrate is usually used as a noun in a general corpus whereas it is a verb 91% of the time in essays written by non-native learners of English.

Some researchers have begun to apply statistical techniques to identify learner errors in the context of essay evaluation (Chodorow & Leacock, 2000; Lonsdale & Strong-Krause, 2003), to detect non-native text (Tomokiyo & Jones, 2001), and to support lexical selection by ESL learners through first-language translation (Liu et al. , 2000).

In addition, we compared our technique with two other methods of checking errors, Microsoft Word03 and ALEK method (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000).

We realize that the grammar checker of Word is a general tool and the performance of ALEK (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) can be improved if larger training data is used.

Instead of asking experts to write hand-crafted rules, statistical approaches (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Izumi et al. , 2003; Brockett et al. , 2006; Nagata et al. , 2006) build statistical models to identify sentences containing errors.

N-gram-based approaches to the problem of error detection have been proposed and implemented in various forms by Atwell(1987), Bigert and Knutsson (2002), and Chodorow and Leacock (2000) amongst others.

Chodorow and Leacock (2000) use a mutual information measure in addition to raw frequency of ngrams.

Title:W07-1607		Conference:Workshop on Prepositions		Author:Rachele De Felice (Oxford University, Oxford UK);Stephen G. Pulman
Chodorow and Leacock (2000) try to identify errors on the basis of context, as we do here, and more speci cally a 2 word window around the word of interest, from which they consider function words and POS tags.

1 Introduction To reduce the efforts taken to correct grammatical errors in English writing, there has been a great deal of work on grammatical error detection (Brockett et al., 2006; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Chodorow and Leacock, 2002; Han et al., 2004; Han et al., 2006; Izumi et al., 2003; Nagata et al., 2004; Nagata et al., 2005; Nagata et al., 2006).

Title:W11-1422		Conference:Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications		Author:Michael Gamon
Chodorow and Leacock (2000) utilized mutual information and chi-square statistics to identify typical contexts for a small set of targeted words from a large well-formed corpus.

Title:P11-4005		Conference:Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Chung-chi Huang;Mei-hua Chen;Shih-ting Huang;Jason S. Chang
For example, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) exploit bigrams and trigrams of function words and partof-speech (PoS) tags, while Sun et al.

Among unsupervised checkers, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) exploits negative evidence from edited textual corpora achieving high precision but low recall, while Tsao and Wible (2009) uses general corpus only.

Title:P11-1121		Conference:Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Ryo Nagata;Edward Whittaker;Vera Sheinman
An example is the error detection method (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000), which identi es unnatural sequences of POSs as grammatical errors in the writing of learners.

Error-tagged learner corpora are crucial for developing and evaluating error detection/correction algorithms such as those described in (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Chodorow et al., 2007; Felice and Pulman, 2008; Han et al., 2004; Han et al., 2006; Izumi et al., 2003b; Lee and Seneff, 2008; Nagata et al., 2004; Nagata et al., 2005; Nagata et al., 2006; Tetreault et al., 2010b).

For example, unsupervised systems of (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) and (Tsao and Wible, 2009) leverage word distributions in general and/or word-specific corpus for detecting erroneous usages while (Hermet et al., 2008) and (Gamon and Leacock, 2010) use Web as a corpus.

The grammar feature covers errors such as sentence fragments, verb form errors and pronoun errors (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000).

POS tag distribution has been used in various tasks such as text genre classification (Feldman et al., 2009); in a language testing context, it has been used in grammatical error detection (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008) andessay scoring

Many of the details have been reported previously (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Han et al, 2004; Han et al, 2006; Chodorow et al, 2007; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008), so here we will only give brief summaries of these modules

3.2.1 Filter-based system The filter-based system combines unsupervised detection of a set of possible errors (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) with hand-crafted filters designed to reduce this set to the largest subset of correctly flagged errors and the smallest possible number of false positives

Title:W12-2027		Conference:Workshop On Building Educational Applications Using NLP		Author:Joel R. Tetreault;Michael Heilman;Aoife Cahill
Chodorow and Leacock (2000) found that low-frequency bigrams (sequences of two lexical categories with a negative log-likelihood) are quite reliable predictors of grammatical errors
