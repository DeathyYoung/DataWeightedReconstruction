We present an unsupervised method for detecting grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from edited textual corpora
The system was developed and tested using essay-length responses to prompts on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).
Our method outperforms Microsoft Word03 and ALEK (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) from Educational Testing Service (ETS) in some cases.
We realize that the grammar checker of Word is a general tool and the performance of ALEK (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) can be improved if larger training data is used.
Instead of asking experts to write hand-crafted rules, statistical approaches (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Izumi et al. , 2003; Brockett et al. , 2006; Nagata et al. , 2006) build statistical models to identify sentences containing errors.
2 Related Work Among the many works on error detection, recently unsupervised error detection approaches have been proposed, such as [Chodorow and Leacock, 2000] and [Quixal and Badia 2008].
Chodorow and Leacock (2000) utilized mutual information and chi-square statistics to identify typical contexts for a small set of targeted words from a large well-formed corpus.
For example, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) exploit bigrams and trigrams of function words and partof-speech (PoS) tags, while Sun et al.
Error-tagged learner corpora are crucial for developing and evaluating error detection/correction algorithms such as those described in (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Chodorow et al., 2007; Felice and Pulman, 2008; Han et al., 2004; Han et al., 2006; Izumi et al., 2003b; Lee and Seneff, 2008; Nagata et al., 2004; Nagata et al., 2005; Nagata et al., 2006; Tetreault et al., 2010b).
POS tag distribution has been used in various tasks such as text genre classification (Feldman et al., 2009); in a language testing context, it has been used in grammatical error detection (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008) andessay scoring
Chodorow and Leacock (2000) found that low-frequency bigrams (sequences of two lexical categories with a negative log-likelihood) are quite reliable predictors of grammatical errors
For instance, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) point out that the word concentrate is usually used as a noun in a general corpus whereas it is a verb 91% of the time in essays written by non-native learners of English.
An unsupervised method (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) is employed to detect grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from TOEFL administrated by ETS.
However, a drawback to it is that there are differences in character between general corpora and the writing of non-native learners of English (Granger, 1998; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000).
Chodorow and Leacock (2000) try to identify errors on the basis of context, as we do here, and more speci cally a 2 word window around the word of interest, from which they consider function words and POS tags.
