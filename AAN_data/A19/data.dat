The evaluation is done using the performance measures described in (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003): precision, recall and F-score on the probable and sure alignments, as well as the Alignment Error Rate (AER), which in our case is a weighted average of the recall on the sure alignments and the precision on the probable.
