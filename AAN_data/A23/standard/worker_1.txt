We propose a semi-automatic tool, ter- might, that helps professional translators and terminologists identify technical terms and their translations. 
The tool makes use of part-of-speech tagging and word- alignment programs to extract candidate terms and their translations. 
Although the extraction programs are far from perfect, it isn't too hard for the user to filter out the wheat from the chaff. 
The extraction algorithms emphasize completeness. Alter- native proposals are likely to miss impor- tant but infrequent terms/translations.
To reduce the burden on the user during the filtering phase, candidates are presented in a convenient order, along with some useful concordance evidence, in an interface that is designed to minimize keystrokes. 
Ter- might is currently being used by the trans-...
Note that these problems are quite similar to the difficulties in translating technical terminology, which also is usually part of a particular technical sublanguage (Dagan and Church 1994).
1 Introduction Corpus-based approaches based on bilingual texts are promising for various applications(i.e. , lexical knowledge extraction (Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Smadja et al. , 1996; Dagan and Church, 1994; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Haruno et al. , 1996), machine translation (Brown and others, 1993; Sato and Nagao, 1990; Kaji et al. , 1992) and information retrieval (Sato, 1992)).
The choice of the linguistic filter affects the precision and recall of the results: having a 'closed' filter, that is, a strict one regarding the part-of-speech sequencies it accepts, like the N + that (Dagan and Church, 1994) use, wilt improve the precision but have bad effect on the recall.
However, in the experiments described here, we focus on alignment at the level of sentences, this for a number of reasons: First, sentence alignments have so far proven their usefulness in a number of applications, e.g. bilingual lexicography (Langlois, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), automatic translation verification (Macklovitch, 1995; Macklovitch, 1996) and the automatic acquisition of knowledge about translation (Brown et al. , 1993).
Co-occurrence information between neighboring words and words in the same sentence has been used in phrase extraction (Smadja, 1993; Fung and Wu, 1994), phrasal translation (Smadja et al. , 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), target word selection (Liu and Li, 1997; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), domain word translation (Fung and Lo, 1998; Fung, 1998), sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991; Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al. , 1992a; Gale et al. , 1992b; Gale et al. , 1992c; Shiitze, 1992; Gale et al. , 1993; Yarowsky, 1995), and even recently for query translation in cross-language IR as well (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998).
On the one hand, the linguistically-based or rule-based approaches use linguistic information such as PoS tags, chunk information, etc. to filter out stop words and restrict candidate terms to predefined syntactic patterns (Ananiadou, 1994), (Dagan and Church, 1994).
Several methods have been proposed with regard to acquiring various kinds of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tanaka, 1994; Yamada et al. , 1995).
2 The two techniques for automatic identification were the technical terms algorithm of Justeson and Katz (1995) and the head sorting method (Dagan and Church (1994); Wacholder (1998).
Related Works Generally speaking, approaches to MWE extraction proposed so far can be divided into three categories: a) statistical approaches based on frequency and co-occurrence affinity, b) knowledgebased or symbolic approaches using parsers, lexicons and language filters, and c) hybrid approaches combining different methods (Smadja 1993; Dagan and Church 1994; Daille 1995; McEnery et al. 1997; Wu 1997; Wermter et al. 1997; Michiels and Dufour 1998; Merkel and Andersson 2000; Piao and McEnery 2001; Sag et al. 2001a, 2001b; Biber et al. 2003).
