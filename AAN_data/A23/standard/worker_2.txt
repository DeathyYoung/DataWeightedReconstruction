We propose a semi-automatic tool, ter- might, that helps professional translators and terminologists identify technical terms and their translations. 
The tool makes use of part-of-speech tagging and word- alignment programs to extract candidate terms and their translations. 
1 Introduction Corpus-based approaches based on bilingual texts are promising for various applications(i.e. , lexical knowledge extraction (Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Smadja et al. , 1996; Dagan and Church, 1994; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Haruno et al. , 1996), machine translation (Brown and others, 1993; Sato and Nagao, 1990; Kaji et al. , 1992) and information retrieval (Sato, 1992)).
The choice of the linguistic filter affects the precision and recall of the results: having a 'closed' filter, that is, a strict one regarding the part-of-speech sequencies it accepts, like the N + that (Dagan and Church, 1994) use, wilt improve the precision but have bad effect on the recall.
Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994).
Some of the early statistical terminology translation methods are (Brown et al. , 1993; Wu and Xia, 1994; Dagan and Church, 1994; Gale and Church, 1991; Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al. , 1996; Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; Fung, 1995b).
Bilingual alignments have so far shown that they can play multiple roles in a wide range of linguistic applications, such as computer assisted translation (Isabelle et al. , 1993; Brown et al. , 1990), terminology (Dagan and Church, 1994) lexicography (Langlois, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Melamed, 1996), and cross-language information retrieval (Nie et al. , * This research was funded by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (http://~.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/), via the Agence de la francophonie (http://~
Co-occurrence information between neighboring words and words in the same sentence has been used in phrase extraction (Smadja, 1993; Fung and Wu, 1994), phrasal translation (Smadja et al. , 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), target word selection (Liu and Li, 1997; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), domain word translation (Fung and Lo, 1998; Fung, 1998), sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991; Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al. , 1992a; Gale et al. , 1992b; Gale et al. , 1992c; Shiitze, 1992; Gale et al. , 1993; Yarowsky, 1995), and even recently for query translation in cross-language IR as well (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998).
Most of the research has focused on bilingual terminology identification, either as parallel multiwords forms (e.g. the ChampoUion system (Smadja et a1.1996)), technical terminology (e.g. the Termight system (Dagan and Church, 1994) or broad-coverage translation lexicons (e.g. the SABLE system (Resnik and Melamed, 1997)).
On the one hand, the linguistically-based or rule-based approaches use linguistic information such as PoS tags, chunk information, etc. to filter out stop words and restrict candidate terms to predefined syntactic patterns (Ananiadou, 1994), (Dagan and Church, 1994).
Several methods have been proposed with regard to acquiring various kinds of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tanaka, 1994; Yamada et al. , 1995).
Another approach, begun more recently than our work, is taken by Dagan and Church (1994), who use statistical methods to translate technical terminology.
A simpler, related idea of penalizing distortion from some ideal matching pattern can be found in the statistical translation (Brown et al. 1990; Brown et al. 1993) and word alignment (Dagan et al. 1993; Dagan & Church 1994) models.
Dagan and Church (1994) reports that their Termight system helped double the speed at which terminology lists could be compiled at the AT&T Business Translation Services.
2 The two techniques for automatic identification were the technical terms algorithm of Justeson and Katz (1995) and the head sorting method (Dagan and Church (1994); Wacholder (1998).
