We propose a semi-automatic tool, ter- might, that helps professional translators and terminologists identify technical terms and their translations. 
The tool makes use of part-of-speech tagging and word- alignment programs to extract candidate terms and their translations. 
Although the extraction programs are far from perfect, it isn't too hard for the user to filter out the wheat from the chaff. 
The extraction algorithms emphasize completeness. Alter- native proposals are likely to miss impor- tant but infrequent terms/translations.
A simpler, related idea of penalizing distortion from some ideal matching pattern can be found in the statistical translation (Brown et al. 1990; Brown et al. 1993) and word alignment (Dagan et al. 1993; Dagan & Church 1994) models.
Several methods have been proposed with regard to acquiring various kinds of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tanaka, 1994; Yamada et al. , 1995).
(Justeson and Katz, 1995) and (Dagan and Church, 1994) use the frequency of occurrence of the candidate string as a measure of its likelihood to be a term.
However, in the experiments described here, we focus on alignment at the level of sentences, this for a number of reasons: First, sentence alignments have so far proven their usefulness in a number of applications, e.g. bilingual lexicography (Langlois, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), automatic translation verification (Macklovitch, 1995; Macklovitch, 1996) and the automatic acquisition of knowledge about translation (Brown et al. , 1993).
On the one hand, the linguistically-based or rule-based approaches use linguistic information such as PoS tags, chunk information, etc. to filter out stop words and restrict candidate terms to predefined syntactic patterns (Ananiadou, 1994), (Dagan and Church, 1994).
Co-occurrence information between neighboring words and words in the same sentence has been used in phrase extraction (Smadja, 1993; Fung and Wu, 1994), phrasal translation (Smadja et al. , 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), target word selection (Liu and Li, 1997; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), domain word translation (Fung and Lo, 1998; Fung, 1998), sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991; Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al. , 1992a; Gale et al. , 1992b; Gale et al. , 1992c; Shiitze, 1992; Gale et al. , 1993; Yarowsky, 1995), and even recently for query translation in cross-language IR as well (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998).
(Dagan and Church, 1994), accept sequencies of nouns, which give them high precision, but not such a good recall as that of (Justeson and Katz, 1995), which allow some prepositions (i.e. oj~ to be part of the extracted candidate terms.
It is true that various term extraction systems have been developed, such as Xtract (Smadja 1993), Termight (Dagan & Church 1994), and TERMS (Justeson & Katz 1995) among others (cf.
Note that these problems are quite similar to the difficulties in translating technical terminology, which also is usually part of a particular technical sublanguage (Dagan and Church 1994).
This paper applies the SABLE system to a much smaller (approximately 400,000 word) corpus in a technical domain, and assesses its potential contribution to the semi-automatic acquisition process outlined above, very much in the spirit of Dagan and Church (1994) and Daille et al.
In the case of word_align (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Dagan and Church 1994), a penalty is imposed according to the deviation from an ideal matching, as constructed by linear interpolation?
