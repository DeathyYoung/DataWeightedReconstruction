In this paper, we describe the pronominal anaphora resolution module of Lucy, a portable English understanding system. The design of this mo;clule was motivated by the observation that, al- though there exist many theories of anaphora resolu- tion, no one of these theories is complete. Thus we have implemented a blackboard-like architecture in which individual partial theories can be encoded as separate modules that can interact to propose can- didate antecedents and to evaluate each other's proposals.

The systems described by Asher and Wada (1988), Carbonell and Brown (1988), and Rich and LuperFoy (1988) are examples of this mixed evaluation strategy.

Thus, for example, Rich and LuperFoy (1988) propose a system that computes the global preference value of a candidate from the scores provided by a set of constraint source modules, in which each module invokes different sorts of conditions for ranking the antecedent candidate.

Introduction For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).

This layer is reminiscent of the independent anaphora resolution modules in the Lucy system (Rich and LuperFoy, 1988), except that modules in that system were not designed to be easily turned on or off.

Whereas knowledge-based systems like (Carbonell and Brown, 1988) and (Rich and LuperFoy, 1988) combining multiple resolution strategies are expensive in the cost of human effort at development time and limited ability to scale to new domains, more recent knowledge-poor approaches like (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996) and (Mitkov, 1998) address the problem without sophisticated linguistic knowledge.

This is often done in an admittedly ad hoc way, requiring tricky retuning when new evidence is added (Rich and LuperFoy 1988).

On the other hand, many of these systems work in a real-world environment (Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Lappin and Leass 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996) in which noisy data and incomplete, sometimes even faulty, analysis results have to be accounted for.

These combine the variety of available evidence, each one usually annotated by a specific weight factor, and, finally, map the weights to a single salience score (Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Haji~ovG KuboG and Kubo~ 1992; Lappin and Leass 1994) These heuristics helped to improve the performance of discourse-understanding systems through significant reductions of the available search-space for antecedents.

Much of the earlier work in anaphora resolution heavily exploited domain and linguistic knowledge (Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Carbonell and Brown 1988), which was difficult both to represent and to process, and which required considerable human input.

Introduction Since the so-called integrative approach to anaphor resolution was developed in the late 1980s (Carbonell and Brown 1988; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Asher and Wada 1989), and its practical viability extensively tested (e.g. , Lappin and Leass 1994; Mitkov 1997, 1998), it has been common wisdom that factors determining the antecedents of anaphors divide into filters and preferences.
