Starting from the early work of Jing & McKeown (2000), in the last decade SC has received considerable attention in the NLP community
We analyzed a set of articles and identified six major operations that can be used for editing the extracted sentences, including removing extraneous phrases from an extracted sentence, combining a reduced sentence with other sentences, syntactic transformation, substituting phrases in an extracted sentence with their paraphrases, substituting phrases with more general or specific descriptions, and reordering the extracted sentences (Jing and McKeown, 1999; Jing and McKeown, 2000)
We present a cut and paste based text summa- rizer, which uses operations derived from an anal- edits extracted sentences, using reduction to remove inessential phrases and combination to merge re- suiting phrases together as coherent sentences
Our work includes a statistically based sentence decom- position program that identifies where the phrases of a summary originate in the original document, pro- ducing an aligned corpus of summaries and articles which we used to develop the summarizer
Jing and McKeown (2000) proposed a system based on extraction and cut-and-paste generation
Automatic text summarization approaches have offered reasonably well-performing approximations for identifiying important sentences (Lin and Hovy, 2002; Schiffman et al
Additionally, some research has explored cutting and pasting segments of text from the full document to generate a summary (Jing and McKeown 2000)
Our work in sentence reformulation is different from cut-and-paste summarization (Jing and McKeown 2000) in many ways
While earlier approaches for text compression were based on symbolic reduction rules (Grefenstette 1998; Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999), more recent approaches use an aligned corpus of documents and their human written summaries to determine which constituents can be reduced (Knight and Marcu 2002; Jing and McKeown 2000; Reizler et al
Jing and McKeown (2000) first extract sentences, then remove redundant phrases, and use (manual) recombination rules to produce coherent output
The recent approach for editing extracted text spans (Jing and McKeown, 2000) may also produce improvement for our algorithm
First, splitting and merging of sentences (Jing and McKeown, 2000), which seems related to content planning and aggregation
Close to the problem studied here is Jing and McKeowns (Jing and McKeown, 2000) cut-and-paste method founded on EndresNiggemeyers observations
Jing and McKeown (2000) studied what edits people use to create summaries from sentences in the source text
This distinguishes our approach from traditional sentence fusion approaches (Jing and McKeown, 2000; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Filippova and Strube, 2008b) which generally attempt to retain common information but are typically evaluated in an abstractive summarization context in which additional information in the fusion output does not negatively impact judgments
