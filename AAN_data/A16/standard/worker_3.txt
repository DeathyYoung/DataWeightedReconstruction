Ultinmtely, however, it seems that a more complex ai)t)roach incorporating back-off and smoothing is necessary ill order to achieve the parsing accuracy achieved by Charniak (1997) and Collins (1997)
Most probabilistic parsing research including, for example, work by by Collins (1997), and Charniak (1997) is based on branching process models (Harris, 1963)
Typical approaches to conversion of constituent structures into dependencies are based on handconstructed head percolation rules, an idea that has its roots in lexicalized constituent parsing (Magerman, 1994; Collins, 1997)
Moreover, as P-DOP is formulated as an enrichment of the treebank Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (PCFG), it allows for much easier comparison to alternative approaches to statistical parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003; Petrov et al
Lexicalized PCFGs use the structural features on the lexical head of phrasal node in a tree, and get significant improvements for parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000)
In batch mode, OpinionFinder parses the data again, this time to obtain constituency parse trees (Collins, 1997), which are then converted to dependency parse trees (Xia and Palmer, 2001)
Manually defined heuristics are used to automatically annotate each tree in the treebank with partially specified HPSG derivation trees: Head/argument/modifier distinctions are made for each node in the tree based on Magerman (1994) and Collins (1997); 336 ODonovan et al
The PCFG is a Markov grammar (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000), i
Due to advances in statistical syntactic parsing techniques (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2001), attention has recently shifted towards the harder question of analyzing the meaning of natural language sentences
Such word-based lexicalizations of probability models are used successfully in the statistical parsing models of, e
Like the models of Goodman (1997), the additional features in our model are generated probabilistically, whereas in the parser of Collins (1997) distance measures are assumed to be a function of the already generated structure and are not generated explicitly
SCISSOR is implemented by augmenting Collins (1997) head-driven parsing model II to incorporate the generation of semantic labels on internal nodes
6 Conclusion Traditional approaches for devising parsing models, smoothing techniques and evaluation metrics are not well suited for MH, as they presuppose 13The lack of head marking, for instance, precludes the use of lexicalized models a la (Collins, 1997)
Head-driven strategies allow for the techniques of lexicalization and Markovization that are widely used in (projective) statistical parsing (Collins, 1997)
com) 1 Introduction Dependency grammar has a long tradition in syntactic theory, dating back to at least Tesni~re's work from the thirties3 Recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing are discovering the importance of relations between words (see, e
