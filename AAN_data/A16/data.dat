In this paper we first propose a new sta- tistical parsing model, which is a genera- tive model of lexicalised context-free gram- mar. We then extend the model to in- clude a probabilistic treatment of both sub- categorisation and wh-movement. Results on Wall Street Journal text show that the parser performs at 88.1/87.5% constituent precision/recall, an average improvement of 2.3% over (Collins 96).

The 75.4% results may seen low compared to parsing results like the 88% precision and recall in (Collins, 1997), but those parsing results include many easier-to-parse constructs.

Examples of formalisms using this approach include the work of Magerman (1995), Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), and Goodman (1997).

In addition, many more sophisticated parsing models are elaborations of such PCFG models, so understanding the properties of PCFGs is likely to be useful (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997).

(owenOcogentex.com) 1 Introduction Dependency grammar has a long tradition in syntactic theory, dating back to at least Tesni~re's work from the thirties3 Recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing are discovering the importance of relations between words (see, e.g., (Collins, 1997)), which is what dependency grammars model explicitly do, but context-free phrasestructure grammars do not.

One can imagine the same techniques coupled with more informative probability distributions, such as lexicalized PCFGs (Charniak, 1997), or even grammars not based upon literal rules, but probability distributions that describe how rules are built up from smaller components (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997).

Title:W99-0622		Conference:Joint SIGDAT Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing And Very Large Corpora		Author:Seagull, Amon; Schubert, Lenhart K.
Also, adding a constituent size/distance effect, as described by Schubert (1986) and as used by some researchers in parsing (e.g. Lesmo and Torasso (1985) and Collins (1997)) would almost certainly improve parsing.

While these approaches have had som e success to date (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a), their usability as parsers in systems for natural language understanding is suspect.

For causativity, the same counting scripts were used for both groups of verbs, but the input to the counting programs was determined by manual inspection of the corpus for verbs belonging to group 1, while it was extracted automatically from a parsed corpus for group 2 (WSJ 1988, parsed with the parser from (Collins, 1997).

Several recent real-world parsers have improved state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by relying on probabilistic or weighted versions of bilexical grammars (Alshawi, 1996; Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997).

In the BB.N model, as with Model 2 of (Collins, 1997), modifying nonterminals are generated conditioning both on the parent P and its head child H. Unlike Model 2 of (Collins, 1997), they are also generated conditioning on the previously generated modifying nonterminal, L/-1 or Pq-1, and there is no subcat frame or distance feature.

1 Introduction In the field of statistical parsing, various probabilistic evaluation models have been proposed where different models use different feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Brown, 1991] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [Collins, 1997] [Magerman, 1991] [Magerman, 1992] [Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996].

A statistical language model a lexicalized PCFG (similar to that of Collins, 1997) is derived from the analysis grammar by processing a corpus using the same grammar with no statistical model and recording frequencies of substructures built by each rule.

The reported results for the full parse tree (on section 23) are recall/precision of 88.1/87.5 (Collins, 1997).

Title:W01-0706		Conference:Workshop On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Li, Xin; Roth, Dan
For the full parser, we use the one developed by Michael Collins (Collins, 1996; Collins, 1997) one of the most accurate full parsers around.

Title:W01-0706		Conference:Workshop On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Li, Xin; Roth, Dan
Thus, over the past few years, along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a; Charniak, 1997b; Ratnaparkhi, 1997), significant progress has been made on the use of statistical learning methods to recognize shallow parsing patterns syntactic phrases or words that participate in a syntactic relationship (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Argamon et al. , 1998; Cardie and Pierce, 1998; Munoz et al. , 1999; Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Buchholz et al. , 1999; Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).

Title:W01-0706		Conference:Workshop On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Li, Xin; Roth, Dan
However, since work in this direction has started, a significant progress has also been made in the research on statistical learning of full parsers, both in terms of accuracy and processing time (Charniak, 1997b; Charniak, 1997a; Collins, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1997).

So the sequence with a fork, which corresponds to only one nucleus is treated as a three word sequence in model C. Apart from this difference, model C directly relies on a combination of equations (10) and (12), namely conditioning by a80a7a81a49a82a9a12, a74a61a8a65a75a57a12 and a74a61a8a65a75a57a14a61a86, both the probability of generating a74a61a8a65a75 a47 and the one of generating a80a7a81a49a82 a47 . Thus, model C uses a reduced version of equation (12) and an extended version of 2Other models, as (Collins and Brooks, 1995; Merlo et al. , 1998) for PP-attachment resolution, or (Collins, 1997; Samuelsson, 2000) for probabilistic parsing, are somewhat related, but their supervised nature makes any direct comparison impossible.

It has been shown repeatedly--e.g. , Briscoe and Carroll (1993), Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), Inui et al.

Title:J01-2004		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Roark, Brian
Examples of this are bilexical grammars--such as Eisner and Satta (1999), Charniak (1997), Collins (1997)--where the lexical heads of each constituent are annotated on both the rightand left-hand sides of the context-free rules, under the constraint that every constituent inherits the lexical head from exactly one of its children, and the lexical head of a POS is its terminal item.

The most common answer is component testing, where the component is compared against a standard of goodness, usually the Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al. , 1993), allowing a numerical score of precision and recall (e.g. Collins, 1997).

In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the model, all sentences were first automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and parsed using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997).

In Experiment 1, we applied three standard parsing models from the literature to Negra: an unlexicalized PCFG model (the baseline), Carroll and Rooths (1998) head-lexicalized model, and Collinss (1997) model based on head-head dependencies.

3.3 Collinss Head-Lexicalized Model In contrast to Carroll and Rooths (1998) approach, the model proposed by Collins (1997) does not compute rule probabilities directly.

We first added sister-head dependencies for NPs (following Collinss (1997) original proposal) and then for PPs, which are flat in Negra, and thus similar in structure to NPs (see Section 2.2).

Lexicalization can increase parsing performance dramatically for English (Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Charniak, 1997, 2000; Collins, 1997), and the lexicalized model proposed by Collins (1997) has been successfully applied to Czech (Collins et al. , 1999) and Chinese (Bikel and Chiang, 2000).

Features For each frame element, features are extracted from the surface text of the sentence and from an automatically generated syntactic parse tree (Collins, 1997).

First, we extend the mechanism of adding gap variables for nodes dominating a site of discontinuity (Collins, 1997).

Title:P03-1055		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Dienes, Peter; Dubey, Amit
The idea of threading EEs to their antecedents in a stochastic parser was proposed by Collins (1997), following the GPSG tradition (Gazdar et al. , 1985).

Title:P03-1055		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Dienes, Peter; Dubey, Amit
However, such constructions prove to be difficult for stochastic parsers (Collins et al. , 1999) and they either avoid tackling the problem (Charniak, 2000; Bod, 2003) or only deal with a subset of the problematic cases (Collins, 1997).

Title:P03-1055		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Dienes, Peter; Dubey, Amit
controlled NP-traces (NPNP), we follow the standard technique of marking nodes dominating the empty element up to but not including the parent of the antecedent as defective (missing an argument) with a gap feature (Gazdar et al. , 1985; Collins, 1997).1 Furthermore, to make antecedent co-indexation possible with many types of EEs, we generalize Collins approach by enriching the annotation of non-terminals with the type of the EE in question (eg.

However, existing models of disambiguation with lexicalized grammars are a mere extension of lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammars (LPCFG) (Collins, 1996; Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), which are based on the decomposition of parsing results into the syntactic/semantic dependencies of two words in a sentence under the assumption of independence of the dependencies.

2.1 Lexicalized parse trees The first successful work on syntactic disambiguation was based on lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar (LPCFG) (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997).

what does student want to write your Figure 3: A derivation tree of lexicalized parse trees, such as the distinction of arguments/modifiers and unbounded dependencies (Collins, 1997), are elegantly represented in derivation trees.

Title:W03-0401		Conference:Conference On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Miyao, Yusuke; Tsujii, Jun'ichi
Since an existing study incorporates these relations ad hoc (Collins, 1997), they are apparently crucial in accurate disambiguation.

The creation of the Penn English Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993), a syntactically interpreted corpus, played a crucial role in the advances in natural language parsing technology (Collins, 1997; Collins, 2000; Charniak, 2000) for English.

Bikel and Chiang (2000) in fact contains two parsers: one is a lexicalized probabilistic contextfree grammar (PCFG) similar to (Collins, 1997); the other is based on statistical TAG (Chiang, 2000).

The PCFG is a Markov grammar (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000), i.e. the production probabilities are estimated by decomposing the joint probability of the categories on the right-hand side into a product of conditionals via the chain rule, and making a Markov assumption.

Title:W03-1706		Conference:SIGHAN Workshop On Chinese Language Processing		Author:Sun, Honglin; Jurafsky, Daniel
To make the model more practical in parameter estimation, we assume the features in feature set FS are independent from each other, thus: = FSFi AFiPAFSP ),|(),|( (5) Under this PCFG+PF model, the goal of a parser is to choose a parse that maximizes the following score: )|,(maxarg)|( 1 AFS i i i n i T PSTScore = = (6) Our model is thus a simplification of more sophisticated models which integrate PCFGs with features, such as those in Magerman(1995), Collins(1997) and Goodman(1997).

Statistical disambiguation such as (Collins and Brooks, 1995) for PP-attachment or (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) for generative parsing greatly improve disambiguation, but as they model by imitation instead of by understanding, complete soundness has to remain elusive.

Previous approaches to the problem (Collins, 1997; Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003a,b; Higgins, 2003) have all been learning-based; the primary difference between the present algorithm and earlier ones is that it is not learned, but explicitly incorporates principles of GovernmentBinding theory (Chomsky, 1981), since that theory underlies the annotation.

Recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing have emphasized the importance of relations between words (see, e.g., (Collins, 1997)), which is what dependency grammars model explicitly, but context-free phrase-structure grammars do not.

Specifically, the following information can be either automatically identified or manually annotated: Syntactic structures automatically identified from a parser (Collins, 1997); Semantic roles of entities in the question (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Gildea and Palmer 2002; Surdeanu et al. , 2003); Discourse roles either manually annotated or identified by rules that map directly from semantic roles to discourse roles.

Another consequence of not generating posthead conjunctions and punctuation as first-class words is that they 19 In fact, if punctuation occurs before the head, it is not generated at alla deficiency in the parsing model that appears to be a holdover from the deficient punctuation handling in the model of Collins (1997).

Due to advances in statistical syntactic parsing techniques (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2001), attention has recently shifted towards the harder question of analyzing the meaning of natural language sentences.

Title:P04-1058		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Infante-Lopez, Gabriel; de Rijke, Maarten
As a side product, we find empirical evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of rule lexicalization techniques (Collins, 1997; Simaan, 2000) and parent annotation techniques (Klein and Manning, 2003) is due to the fact that both lead to a reduction in perplexity in the automata induced from training corpora.

Title:P04-1058		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Infante-Lopez, Gabriel; de Rijke, Maarten
One attempt to implement this idea is lexicalization: increasing the information in the POS tag by adding the lemma to it (Collins, 1997; Simaan, 2000).

Moreover, the deterministic dependency parser of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), when trained on the Penn Treebank, gives a dependency accuracy that is almost as good as that of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000).

Title:C04-1010		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Nivre, Joakim; Scholz, Mario
This permits us to make exact comparisons with the parser of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), but also the parsers of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000), which are evaluated on the same data set in Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).

On the other hand, the best available parsers trained on the Penn Treebank, those of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000), use statistical models for disambiguation that make crucial use of dependency relations.

Table 2 shows the dependency accuracy, root accuracy and complete match scores for our best parser (Model 2 with label set B) in comparison with Collins (1997) (Model 3), Charniak (2000), and Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).5 It is clear that, with respect to unlabeled accuracy, our parser does not quite reach state-of-the-art performance, even if we limit the competition to deterministic methods such as that of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).

In the following section, we follow the notation in (Collins, 1997).

Title:W05-0602		Conference:Conference On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Ge, Ruifang; Mooney, Raymond J.
Only one word is labeled with the concept; the syntactic head word (Collins, 1997) is preferred.

Title:W05-0602		Conference:Conference On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Ge, Ruifang; Mooney, Raymond J.
The syntactic parameters are the same as in Section 5.1 and are smoothed as in (Collins, 1997).

Title:W05-0602		Conference:Conference On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Ge, Ruifang; Mooney, Raymond J.
All words occurring less than 3 times in the training data, and words in test data that were not seen in training, are unknown words and are replaced with the UNKNOWN token. Note this threshold is smaller than the one used in (Collins, 1997) since the corpora used in our experiments are smaller.

Title:W05-0602		Conference:Conference On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Ge, Ruifang; Mooney, Raymond J.
Otherwise they are generated along with the words using the same approach as in (Collins, 1997).

As in (Collins, 1997), the parameter C8 D0 B4C4 CX B4D0D8 CX BND0DB CX B5CYC8BNC0BNDBBND8BNA1BNC4BVB5 is further smoothed as follows: C8 D0BD B4C4 CX CYC8BNC0BNDBBND8BNA1BNC4BVB5 A2 C8 D0BE B4D0D8 CX CYC8BNC0BNDBBND8BNA1BNC4BVBNC4 CX B5A2 C8 D0BF B4D0DB CX CYC8BNC0BNDBBND8BNA1BNC4BVBNC4 CX B4D0D8 CX B5B5 Note this smoothing is different from the syntactic counterpart.

Manually defined heuristics are used to automatically annotate each tree in the treebank with partially specified HPSG derivation trees: Head/argument/modifier distinctions are made for each node in the tree based on Magerman (1994) and Collins (1997); 336 ODonovan et al. Large-Scale Induction and Evaluation of Lexical Resources the whole tree is then converted to a binary tree; heuristics are applied to deal with phenomena such as LDDs and coordination and to correct some errors in the treebank, and finally an HPSG category is assigned to each node in the tree in accordance with its CFG category.

Although state-of-the-art statistical parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) are more accurate, the simplicity and efficiency of deterministic parsers make them attractive in a number of situations requiring fast, light-weight parsing, or parsing of large amounts of data.

Furthermore, Bikel (2004) provides evidence that lexical information (in the form of bi-lexical dependencies) only makes a small contribution to the performance of parsing models such as Collinss (1997).

Previous work for English (e.g. , Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997) has shown that lexicalization leads to a sizable improvement in parsing performance.

In general, these authors have found that existing lexicalized parsing models for English (e.g. , Collins 1997) do not straightforwardly generalize to new languages; this typically manifests itself in a severe reduction in parsing performance compared to the results for English.

By contrast, alternative approaches, like Collins (1997), apply an additional transformation to each tree in the tree-bank, splitting each rule into small parts, which finally results in a new grammar covering many more sentences than the explicit one.

2 Head Lexicalization As previously shown (Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), Carroll and Rooth (1998), etc.), ContextFree Grammars (CFGs) can be transformed to lexicalized CFGs, provided that a head-marking scheme for rules is given.

Title:W05-1512		Conference:International Workshop On Parsing Technology		Author:Prescher, Detlef
The most important tree-bank transformation in the literature is lexicalization: Each node in a tree is labeled with its head word, the most important word of the constituent under the node (Magerman (1995), Collins (1996), Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), Carroll and Rooth (1998), etc.).

1 Introduction Mainstream approaches in statistical parsing are based on nondeterministic parsing techniques, usually employing some kind of dynamic programming, in combination with generative probabilistic models that provide an n-best ranking of the set of candidate analyses derived by the parser (Collins, 1997; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).

An early exception to this was (Collins, 1997) itself, where Model 2 used function tags during the training process for heuristics to identify arguments (e.g. , the TMP tag on the NP in Figure 1 disqualifies the NP-TMP from being treated as an argument).

1 Introduction Over the past decade, there has been tremendous progress on learning parsing models from treebank data (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Wang et al. , 2005; McDonald et al. , 2005).

Title:W06-2904		Conference:Conference On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Wang, Qin Iris; Cherry, Colin; Lizotte, Dan; Schuurmans, Dale
Most of the early work in this area was based on postulating generative probability models of language that included parse structure (Collins, 1997).

Title:W06-2904		Conference:Conference On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Wang, Qin Iris; Cherry, Colin; Lizotte, Dan; Schuurmans, Dale
Learning in this context consisted of estimating the parameters of the model with simple likelihood based techniques, but incorporating various smoothing and back-off estimation tricks to cope with the sparse data problems (Collins, 1997; Bikel, 2004).

(2005) have implemented a dependency parser with good accuracy (it is almost as good at dependency parsing as Charniak (2000)) and very impressive speed (it is about ten times faster than Collins (1997) and four times faster than Charniak (2000)).

Some of the more popular and more accurate of these approaches to data-driven parsing (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1997; Klein and Manning, 2002) have been based on generative models that are closely related to probabilistic contextfree grammars.

This kind of smoothing has also been used in the generative parser of (Collins, 1997) and has been shown to have a relatively good performance for language modeling (Goodman, 2001).

Title:W06-1668		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Toutanova, Kristina
To avoid this problem, generative models for NLP tasks have often been manually designed to achieve an appropriate representation of the joint distribution, such as in the parsing models of (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000).

Probability estimates of the RHS given the LHS are often smoothed by making a Markov assumption regarding the conditional independence of a category on those more than k categories away (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000): P(X Y1Yn)= P(Y1|X) nY i=2 P(Yi|X,Y1 Yi1) P(Y1|X) nY i=2 P(Yi|X,Yik Yi1).

In order to objectively evaluate our representation, we derived it from two different sources: constituency parse trees (generated with our implementation of (Collins, 1997)) and dependency parse trees (created using Minipar (Lin, 1998))1.

Title:W06-1636		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Headden III, William P.; Charniak, Eugene; Johnson, Mark
Instead researchers condition parsing decisions on many other features, such as parent phrase-marker, and, famously, the lexical-head of the phrase (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1996; Collins, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Charniak, 2000; Henderson, 2003; Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al. , 2005) (and others).

Furthermore, I based training on maximizing the conditional probability of a parse tree given a sentence, unlike most previous generative models (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), which focus on maximizing the joint probability of the parse tree and the sentence.

Even before the 2006 shared task, the parsers of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000), originally developed for English, had been adapted for dependency parsing of Czech, and the parsing methodology proposed by Kudo and Matsumoto (2002) and Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) had been evaluated on both Japanese and English.

Sometimes, due to data sparseness and/or limitations in the machine learning paradigm used, we need to extract features from the available representation in a manner that profoundly changes the representation (as is done in bilexical parsing (Collins, 1997)).

Moreover, as P-DOP is formulated as an enrichment of the treebank Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (PCFG), it allows for much easier comparison to alternative approaches to statistical parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003; Petrov et al. , 2006).

All state-of-the-art wide-coverage parsers relax this assumption in some way, for instance by (i) changing the parser in step (3), such that the application of rules is conditioned on other steps in the derivation process (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), or by (ii) enriching the nonterminal labels in step (1) with context-information (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003), along with suitable backtransforms in step (4).

Title:J07-3004		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Hockenmaier, Julia; Steedman, Mark
Typically, frequency information for rare words in the training data is used to estimate parameters for unknown words (and when these rare or unknown words are encountered during parsing, additional information may be obtained from a POS-tagger (Collins 1997)).

These forest rescoring algorithms have potential applications to other computationally intensive tasks involving combinations of different models, for example, head-lexicalized parsing (Collins, 1997); joint parsing and semantic role labeling (Sutton and McCallum, 2005); or tagging and parsing with nonlocal features.

As is common (Collins, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003; Schmid, 2006), the treebank is first transformed in various ways, in order to give an accurate PCFG.

Recently, specic probabilistic tree-based models have been proposed not only for machine translation (Wu 1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas 2000; Yamada and Knight 2001; Eisner 2003; Gildea 2003), but also for summarization (Knight and Marcu 2002), paraphrasing (Pang, Knight, and Marcu 2003), natural language generation (Langkilde and Knight 1998; Bangalore and Rambow 2000; Corston-Oliver et al. 2002), parsing, and language modeling (Baker 1979; Lari and Young 1990; Collins 1997; Chelba and Jelinek 2000; Charniak 2001; Klein Information Sciences Institute, 4676 Admiralty Way, Marina del Rey, CA 90292.

The last issue is how our binarization performs on a lexicalized parser, like Collins (1997).

Title:D08-1018		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Song, Xinying; Ding, Shilin; Lin, Chin-Yew
Therefore in Collins (1997) grammar rules are already factorized into a set of probabilities.

Title:D08-1018		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Song, Xinying; Ding, Shilin; Lin, Chin-Yew
In order to capture the dependency relationship between lexcial heads Collins (1997) breaks down the rules from head outwards, which prevents us from factorizing them in other ways.

Title:D08-1018		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Song, Xinying; Ding, Shilin; Lin, Chin-Yew
It is equipped with head binarization to help improve parsing accuracy, following the traditional linguistic insight that phrases are organized around the head (Collins, 1997; Klein and Manning, 2003b).

Title:D08-1018		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Song, Xinying; Ding, Shilin; Lin, Chin-Yew
Our intuition is that we cannot apply our binarization to Collins (1997).

The results so far mainly come from studies where a parser originally developed for English,such as the Collins parser (Collins 1997,1999), is applied to a new language,which often leads to a signicant decrease in the measured accuracy (Collins et al. 1999; Bikel and Chiang 2000; Dubey and Keller 2003; Levy and Manning 2003; Corazza et al. 2004).

It is interesting to note that, while the study of how the granularity of context-free grammars (CFG) affects the performance of a parser (e.g. in the form 86 n1:IP [=] n2:NP [SUBJ=] n4:NR [=] GSC4ES JiangZemin n3:VP [=] n5:VV [=] ESDO interview n6:NP [OBJ=] n7:NR [ADJUNCT] AIC1 Thai n8:NN [=] D3D2 president f1 PRED ESDO SUBJ f2 PRED GSC4ESNTYPE proper NUM sg OBJ f3 PRED D3D2 NTYPE common NUM sg ADJUNCT f4 PRED AIC1NTYPE proper NUM sg : N F (n1)=(n3)=(n5)=f1 (n2)=(n4)=f2 (n6)=(n8)=f3 (n7)=f4 Figure 1: Cand f-structures with links for the sentence GSC4ESESDOAIC1D3D2 of grammar transforms (Johnson, 1998) and lexicalisation (Collins, 1997)) has attracted substantial attention, to our knowledge, there has been a lot less research on this subject for surface realisation, a process that is generally regarded as the reverse process of parsing.

3.1 A History-Based Model The history-based (HB) approach which incorporates more context information has worked well in parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000).

Methodologies such as lexicalisation (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) and tree transformations (Johnson, 1998), weaken the independence assumptions and have been applied successfully to parsing and shown significant improvements over simple PCFGs.

While it was initially believed that lexicalization of PCFG parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) is crucial for obtaining good parsing results, Gildea (2001) demonstrated that the lexicalized Model-1 parser of Collins (1997) does not benefit from bilexical information when tested on a new text domain, and only marginally benefits from such information when tested on the same text domain as the training corpora.

Since this transform takes a probabilistic grammar as input, it can also easily accommodate horizontal and vertical Markovisation (annotating grammar symbols with parent and sibling categories) as described by Collins (1997) and subsequently.

2.4 GermanEnglish For GermanEnglish, we additionally incorporated rule-based reordering We parse the input using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997) and apply a set of reordering rules to re-arrange the German sentence so that it corresponds more closely English word order (Collins et al., 2005).

3 For Spanish and French, it was shown by Cowan and Collins (2005) and in (Arun and Keller, 2005; Schluter and van Genabith, 2007), that restructuring the treebanks native annotation scheme to match the PTB annotation style led to a significant gain in parsing performance of Head-Driven models of the kind proposed in (Collins, 1997).

The structured vectorial semantic framework subsumes variants of several common parsing algorithms, two of which will be discussed: lexicalized parsing (Charniak, 1996; Collins, 1997, etc.) and relational clustering (akin to latent annotations (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006; Gesmundo et al., 2009)).

Subsequently, each branch was annotated with a head relation nullID or a modifier relation nullMOD according to a binarized version of headword percolation rules (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997), and the headword was propagated up from its head constituent.
