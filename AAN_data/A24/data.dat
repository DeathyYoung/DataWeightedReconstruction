We propose a method for identifying diathesis alter- nations where a particular argument type is seen in slots which have different grammatical roles in the alternating forms. The method uses selectional pref- erences acquired as probability distributions over WordNet. Preferences for the target slots are com- pared using a measure of distributional similarity. The method is evaluated on the causative and cona- tive alternations, but is generally applicable and does not require a priori knowledge specific to the alternation.

McCarthy (2000) shows that a method very similar to ours can be used for identifying alternations.

Title:J01-3003		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Paola Merlo (University of Geneva, Geneva Switzerland);Suzanne Stevenson (University of Toronto, Toronto ON)
Also, the method of counting correctness entails that some "correct" classes may be split across distant clusters (this level of detail is not reported), so it is unclear how coherent the class behaviour actually is. McCarthy (2000) proposes a method to identify diathesis alternations.

On the other hand, when learning of thematic role assignment has been the explicit goal, the text has been semantically annotated (Webster and Marcus 1989), or external semantic resources have been consulted (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000).

Title:J01-3003		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Paola Merlo (University of Geneva, Geneva Switzerland);Suzanne Stevenson (University of Toronto, Toronto ON)
We, like others in a computational framework, have extended this idea by showing that statistics over the alternants of a verb effectively capture information about its class (Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 1999).

Title:J01-3003		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Paola Merlo (University of Geneva, Geneva Switzerland);Suzanne Stevenson (University of Toronto, Toronto ON)
Other work has attempted to learn deeper semantic properties such as selectional restrictions (Resnik 1996; Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998), verbal aspect (Klavans and Chodorow 1992; Siegel 1999), or lexical-semantic verb classes such as those proposed by Levin (1993) (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 1999; Schulte im Walde 2000).

To do this, counts of training data were percolated up the semantic hierarchy in a technique similar to that of, for example, McCarthy (2000).

Title:J02-2003		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Stephen Clark (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK);David Weir (University of Sussex, East Sussex UK)
Previous work has considered how to estimate probabilities using classes from WordNet in the context of acquiring selectional preferences (Resnik 1998; Ribas 1995; Li and Abe 1998; McCarthy 2000), and this previous work has also addressed the question of how to determine a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy.

Title:J02-2003		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Stephen Clark (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK);David Weir (University of Sussex, East Sussex UK)
This is the approach taken by Li and Abe (1998), Ribas (1995), and McCarthy (2000).

Title:J02-2003		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Stephen Clark (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK);David Weir (University of Sussex, East Sussex UK)
Ribas (1995), Li and Abe (1998), McCarthy (2000), and Wagner (2000) all use some kind of thresholding when dealing with counts in the hierarchy (although not in the context of a chi-square test).

Title:J02-2003		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Stephen Clark (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK);David Weir (University of Sussex, East Sussex UK)
We used McCarthys (2000) implementation of MDL.

Alternative Class-Based Estimation Methods The approaches used for comparison are that of Resnik (1993, 1998), subsequently developed by Ribas (1995), and that of Li and Abe (1998), which has been adopted by McCarthy (2000).

Research on unsupervised acquisition of lexical information from corpora, such as argument structure of predicates (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; McCarthy, 2000), word classes for disambiguation (Clark and Weir, 2001), and collocations (Lin 1999), has used grammatical relation/head/dependent tuples

McCarthy (2000), Merlo and Stevenson (2001), and Schulte im Walde (2000) have evaluated their systems accuracy against human judgments of verb classification, with the comprehensive verb classes of Levin (1993) often serving as a gold standard.

As in McCarthy (2000), the nouns are classified using WordNet.

Title:C02-1132		Conference:International Conference on Computational Linguistics		Author:Daniel Gildea (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA)
This idea has been used by McCarthy (2000) to identify verbs participating in specific alternations by looking for overlap between nouns used in different positions, and by using WordNet to classify role fillers into semantic categories.

Title:J03-2004		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Mirella Lapata (University of Sheffield, Sheffield UK);Alex Lascarides (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK)
Probabilities can be defined in terms of senses from a semantic hierarchy by exploiting the fact that the senses can be grouped into classes consisting of semantically similar senses (Resnik 1993; Clark and Weir 2001; McCarthy 2000; Li and Abe 1998).

Title:J03-2004		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Mirella Lapata (University of Sheffield, Sheffield UK);Alex Lascarides (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK)
Furthermore, in agreement with other lexical acquisition studies (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Barzilay and McKeown 2001; Siegel and McKeown 2000; Light 1996; McCarthy 2000; Rooth et al. 1999), we showed that it is possible to extract semantic information from corpora even if they are not semantically annotated in any way.

Title:J03-3005		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Frank Keller (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK);Mirella Lapata (University of Sheffield, Sheffield UK)
Other, more sophisticated class-based methods do away with the simplifying assumption that the argument co-occurring with a given predicate (adjective, noun, verb) is distributed evenly across its conceptual classes and attempt to find the right level of generalization in a concept hierarchy, by discounting, for example, the contribution of very general classes (Clark and Weir 2001; McCarthy 2000; Li and Abe 1998).

Title:W04-2411		Conference:International Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning		Author:Vivian Tsang (University of Toronto, Toronto ON);Suzanne Stevenson
Note that we did not hand-verify that individual verbs allowed or disallowed the alternation, as McCarthy (2000) had done, because we wanted to evaluate our method in the presence of noise of this kind.

Because we demonstrate our new SPD measure on the same problem as McCarthy (2000), we provide more detail of her method here, for comparison.

The method addresses conceptual problems of an earlier measure proposed by McCarthy (2000), which was limited to tree cut models (Li and Abe, 1998) and failed to distinguish detailed semantic differences between them.

Title:W04-2411		Conference:International Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning		Author:Vivian Tsang (University of Toronto, Toronto ON);Suzanne Stevenson
As in McCarthy (2000), we cast argument alternation detection as a comparison of sense profiles across two different argument positions of a verb.

Title:W04-2411		Conference:International Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning		Author:Vivian Tsang (University of Toronto, Toronto ON);Suzanne Stevenson
This means that the kind of straightforward propagation method used by McCarthy (2000) is not applicable to sense profiles of this type.

By comparison, McCarthy (2000) attained 73% accuracy on her set of hand-selected test verbs in a similar task; however, when applied to our randomly selected verbs, our replication of her method achieved an overall performance of 67%, and performed very poorly on low frequency verbs.

We will refer in the remainder of the paper to such a probability distribution over WordNet as a selectional profile. As mentioned above, McCarthy (2000) suggested the use of selectional profiles to capture generalizations over argument slots, so that two argument slots could be effectively compared for detecting alternations.

(For comparison, McCarthy (2000) achieves 73% on her set of hand-selected verbs, but our implementation of her method yields much lower performance on our randomly selected test verbs.)

In contrast to comparing head nouns directly, McCarthy (2000) instead compares the selectional preferences for each of the two slots (captured by a probability distribution over WordNet).

Related Work Levins (1993) seminal study on diathesis alternations and verb semantic classes has recently influenced work in dictionary creation (Dorr 1997; Dang et al. 1998; Dorr and Jones 1996) and notably lexicon acquisition on the basis of the assumption that verbal meaning can be gleaned from corpora using cues pertaining to syntactic structure (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000).

Title:J04-1003		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Mirella Lapata (University of Sheffield, Sheffield UK);Chris Brew (Ohio State University, Columbus OH)
These exploit syntactic cues, or at least cues that are plausibly related to syntax (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000)

Title:W04-2206		Conference:Workshop On Multilingual Linguistic Resources		Author:Sanae Fujita (NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto Japan);Francis Bond
The mapping for the dependents in the alternation can be taken from existing lexical resources (Dorr, 1997), learned from corpora (McCarthy, 2000) or learned from existing lexicons (Bond et al. , 2002).

Another extension is to apply the method to other alternations, using either linguists data or automatically acquired alternations (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1997; Furumaki and Tanaka, 2003; McCarthy, 2000).

More recent work has attempted to group verbs into classes based on alternations, usually taking Levins classes as a gold standard (McCarthy 2000; Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Schulte im Walde and Brew 2002).

In a sense this is encouraging, as it motivates our most exciting future work: augmenting this simplemodel to explicitly capture complementary infor mation such as distributional semantics (Blei et al, 2003), diathesis alternations (McCarthy, 2000) and selectional preferences (O? Se?aghdha, 2010)
