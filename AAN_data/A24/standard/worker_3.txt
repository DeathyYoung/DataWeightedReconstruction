We propose a method for identifying diathesis alter- nations where a particular argument type is seen in slots which have different grammatical roles in the alternating forms. 
The method uses selectional pref- erences acquired as probability distributions over WordNet. 
Preferences for the target slots are com- pared using a measure of distributional similarity. 
The method is evaluated on the causative and cona- tive alternations, but is generally applicable and does not require a priori knowledge specific to the alternation.
On the other hand, when learning of thematic role assignment has been the explicit goal, the text has been semantically annotated (Webster and Marcus 1989), or external semantic resources have been consulted (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000).
Also, the method of counting correctness entails that some "correct" classes may be split across distant clusters (this level of detail is not reported), so it is unclear how coherent the class behaviour actually is. McCarthy (2000) proposes a method to identify diathesis alternations.
Ribas (1995), Li and Abe (1998), McCarthy (2000), and Wagner (2000) all use some kind of thresholding when dealing with counts in the hierarchy (although not in the context of a chi-square test).
Research on unsupervised acquisition of lexical information from corpora, such as argument structure of predicates (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; McCarthy, 2000), word classes for disambiguation (Clark and Weir, 2001), and collocations (Lin 1999), has used grammatical relation/head/dependent tuples
McCarthy (2000), Merlo and Stevenson (2001), and Schulte im Walde (2000) have evaluated their systems accuracy against human judgments of verb classification, with the comprehensive verb classes of Levin (1993) often serving as a gold standard.
Probabilities can be defined in terms of senses from a semantic hierarchy by exploiting the fact that the senses can be grouped into classes consisting of semantically similar senses (Resnik 1993; Clark and Weir 2001; McCarthy 2000; Li and Abe 1998).
By comparison, McCarthy (2000) attained 73% accuracy on her set of hand-selected test verbs in a similar task; however, when applied to our randomly selected verbs, our replication of her method achieved an overall performance of 67%, and performed very poorly on low frequency verbs.
The method addresses conceptual problems of an earlier measure proposed by McCarthy (2000), which was limited to tree cut models (Li and Abe, 1998) and failed to distinguish detailed semantic differences between them.
We illustrate with an example the differences between our measure and both McCarthys (2000) method and general vector distance measures.
In this example, one can propagate the distributions to the lowest common subsumers (i.e. , B, C, and D) as in McCarthy (2000).
Related Work Levins (1993) seminal study on diathesis alternations and verb semantic classes has recently influenced work in dictionary creation (Dorr 1997; Dang et al. 1998; Dorr and Jones 1996) and notably lexicon acquisition on the basis of the assumption that verbal meaning can be gleaned from corpora using cues pertaining to syntactic structure (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000).
