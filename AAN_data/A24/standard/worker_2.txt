We propose a method for identifying diathesis alter- nations where a particular argument type is seen in slots which have different grammatical roles in the alternating forms. 
The method uses selectional pref- erences acquired as probability distributions over WordNet. 
Previous work has considered how to estimate probabilities using classes from WordNet in the context of acquiring selectional preferences (Resnik 1998; Ribas 1995; Li and Abe 1998; McCarthy 2000), and this previous work has also addressed the question of how to determine a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy.
Ribas (1995), Li and Abe (1998), McCarthy (2000), and Wagner (2000) all use some kind of thresholding when dealing with counts in the hierarchy (although not in the context of a chi-square test).
Alternative Class-Based Estimation Methods The approaches used for comparison are that of Resnik (1993, 1998), subsequently developed by Ribas (1995), and that of Li and Abe (1998), which has been adopted by McCarthy (2000).
By comparison, McCarthy (2000) attained 73% accuracy on her set of hand-selected test verbs in a similar task; however, when applied to our various sets of randomly selected verbs, our replication of her method performed very poorly, rarely reaching above chance performance.
We will refer in the remainder of the paper to such a probability distribution over WordNet as a selectional profile. As mentioned above, McCarthy (2000) suggested the use of selectional profiles to capture generalizations over argument slots, so that two argument slots could be effectively compared for detecting alternations.
As in McCarthy (2000), we cast argument alternation detection as a comparison of sense profiles across two different argument positions of a verb.
Because we demonstrate our new SPD measure on the same problem as McCarthy (2000), we provide more detail of her method here, for comparison.
The method addresses conceptual problems of an earlier measure proposed by McCarthy (2000), which was limited to tree cut models (Li and Abe, 1998) and failed to distinguish detailed semantic differences between them.
The approach of McCarthy (2000), on the other hand, addresses the generalization problem by comparing probability distributions over WordNet.
These exploit syntactic cues, or at least cues that are plausibly related to syntax (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000)
We hope to use these models in tasks such as diathesis alternation detection (McCarthy, 2000; Tsang and Stevenson, 2004) and contrast with WordNet models previously used for this purpose.
Furthermore, in agreement with other lexical acquisition studies (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Barzilay and McKeown 2001; Siegel and McKeown 2000; Light 1996; McCarthy 2000; Rooth et al. 1999), we showed that it is possible to extract semantic information from corpora even if they are not semantically annotated in any way.
Probabilities can be defined in terms of senses from a semantic hierarchy by exploiting the fact that the senses can be grouped into classes consisting of semantically similar senses (Resnik 1993; Clark and Weir 2001; McCarthy 2000; Li and Abe 1998).
