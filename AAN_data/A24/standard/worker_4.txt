We propose a method for identifying diathesis alter- nations where a particular argument type is seen in slots which have different grammatical roles in the alternating forms. 
The method uses selectional pref- erences acquired as probability distributions over WordNet. 
Preferences for the target slots are com- pared using a measure of distributional similarity. 
The method is evaluated on the causative and cona- tive alternations, but is generally applicable and does not require a priori knowledge specific to the alternation.
On the other hand, when learning of thematic role assignment has been the explicit goal, the text has been semantically annotated (Webster and Marcus 1989), or external semantic resources have been consulted (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000).
Previous work has considered how to estimate probabilities using classes from WordNet in the context of acquiring selectional preferences (Resnik 1998; Ribas 1995; Li and Abe 1998; McCarthy 2000), and this previous work has also addressed the question of how to determine a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy.
McCarthy (2000), Merlo and Stevenson (2001), and Schulte im Walde (2000) have evaluated their systems accuracy against human judgments of verb classification, with the comprehensive verb classes of Levin (1993) often serving as a gold standard.
This idea has been used by McCarthy (2000) to identify verbs participating in specific alternations by looking for overlap between nouns used in different positions, and by using WordNet to classify role fillers into semantic categories.
Other, more sophisticated class-based methods do away with the simplifying assumption that the argument co-occurring with a given predicate (adjective, noun, verb) is distributed evenly across its conceptual classes and attempt to find the right level of generalization in a concept hierarchy, by discounting, for example, the contribution of very general classes (Clark and Weir 2001; McCarthy 2000; Li and Abe 1998).
As in McCarthy (2000), we cast argument alternation detection as a comparison of sense profiles across two different argument positions of a verb.
We will refer in the remainder of the paper to such a probability distribution over WordNet as a selectional profile. As mentioned above, McCarthy (2000) suggested the use of selectional profiles to capture generalizations over argument slots, so that two argument slots could be effectively compared for detecting alternations.
By comparison, McCarthy (2000) attained 73% accuracy on her set of hand-selected test verbs in a similar task; however, when applied to our various sets of randomly selected verbs, our replication of her method performed very poorly, rarely reaching above chance performance.
The approach of McCarthy (2000), on the other hand, addresses the generalization problem by comparing probability distributions over WordNet.
Related Work Levins (1993) seminal study on diathesis alternations and verb semantic classes has recently influenced work in dictionary creation (Dorr 1997; Dang et al. 1998; Dorr and Jones 1996) and notably lexicon acquisition on the basis of the assumption that verbal meaning can be gleaned from corpora using cues pertaining to syntactic structure (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000).
More recent work has attempted to group verbs into classes based on alternations, usually taking Levins classes as a gold standard (McCarthy 2000; Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Schulte im Walde and Brew 2002).
