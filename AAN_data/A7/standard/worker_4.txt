We use logical inference techniques forrecognising textual entailment. 
As theperformance of theorem proving turnsout to be highly dependent on not read-ily available background knowledge
we incorporate model building, a techniqueborrowed from automated reasoning, and show that it is a useful robust method toapproximate entailment. 
Finally, we usemachine learning to combine these deepsemantic analysis techniques with simpleshallow word overlap
Our results also show that the different tech-niques that we employ perform very dif-ferently on some of the subsets of the RTEcorpus and as a result, it is useful to use thenature of the dataset as a feature.
Finally, a few efforts (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al. , 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005) have tried to 42 translate sentences into formulas of first-order logic, in order to test logical entailment with a theorem prover.
For example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and (Bos and Markert, 2005), which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. when able to use the specific task labels as input.
Some NLP applications deal indirectly with negation, e.g., machine translation (van Munster, 1988), text classification (Rose et al., 2003) and recognizing entailments (Bos and Markert, 2005).
Bos and Markert (2005) describe a system for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) that uses Boxer to convert both the premise and hypothesis of an RTE pair into first-order logical semantic representations and then uses a theorem prover to check for logical entailment.
Note that when running an example in the theorem prover, weights are not possible, so any rule that would be weighted in an MLN is simply treated as a hard clause following Bos and Markert (2005).
They, therefore, tend to have high precision at the cost of low recall (Bos and Markert, 2005).
We show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), graph alignment (Haghighi et al. , 2005), weighted abduction (Raina et al. , 2005), and a mixed system including theorem proving (Bos and Markert, 2005).
The RTE problem as presented in the PASCAL RTE dataset is particularly attractive in that it is a reasonably simple task for human annotators with high inter-annotator agreement (95.1% in one independent labeling (Bos and Markert, 2005)), but an extremely challenging task for automated systems.
Several models, ranging from the simple lexical similarity between T and H to advanced Logic Form Representations, have been proposed (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Glickman and Dagan, 2004; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005).
Many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form (Bayer et al. , 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Raina et al. , 2005; Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).
