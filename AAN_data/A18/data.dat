Title:A00-2004		Conference:Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics		Author:Freddy Y. Y. Choi (University of Manchester, Manchester UK)
This paper describes a method for linear text seg- mentation which is twice as accurate and over seven times as fast as the state-of-the-art (Reynar, 1998). Inter-sentence similarity is replaced by rank in the local context. Boundary locations are discovered by divisive clustering.

9The results for a210 a194a33a194a47a215a135a216a123a217 in Table 3 are slightly different from those listed in Table 6 of Choi 's paper (Choi, 2000).

A lot of research has been done on text segmentation (Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Okumura and Honda, 1994; Salton et al. , 1996; Yaari, 1997; Kan et al. , 1998; Choi, 2000; Nakao, 2000).

This data was used by Choi (2000) to compare various domain-independent text segmentation systems.6 He evaluated a133a26a186a62a186 (Choi, 2000), TextTiling (Hearst, 1994), DotPlot (Reynar, 1998), and Segmenter (Kan et al. , 1998) by using the data and reported that a133a26a186a180a186 achieved the best performance among these systems.

However, a207a32a208a33a208 and a207a32a208a33a208a38a220, which are implemented in C, run as fast as a210 a194a33a194 and a210 a194a33a194 a220, which are implemented in Java (Choi, 2000), due to the difference in programming languages.

Title:P01-1064		Conference:Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Masao Utiyama (Communications Research Laboratory, Kyoto Japan);Hitoshi Isahara
Choi (2000) used the rank of the cosine, rather than the cosine itself, to measure the similarity of sentences.

CWM is described in (Choi, 2001), U00 in (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), C99 in (Choi, 2000), DotPlot in (Reynar, 1998) and Segmenter in (Kan et al. , 1998).

Title:C02-1033		Conference:International Conference on Computational Linguistics		Author:Olivier Ferret (Atomic Energy Commission, Fontenay-aux-Roses France)
As (Choi, 2000) or (Kaufmann, 1999), we use the cosine measure for evaluating the similarity between a vector of the context window (Vw) and the equivalent vector in the segment context (Vs): = i ix i ix ix i ix xx CwwwgCswwg CwwgwCswwg VwVssim 22 ),(),( ),(),( ),( (5) where wgx(wi,Cs,w}) is the weight of the word wi in the vector x (txt or coll) of the context Cs,w}.

Title:C02-1033		Conference:International Conference on Computational Linguistics		Author:Olivier Ferret (Atomic Energy Commission, Fontenay-aux-Roses France)
Most of those that achieve text segmentation only rely on the intrinsic characteristics of texts: word distribution, as in (Hearst, 1997), (Choi, 2000) and (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), or linguistic cues as in (Passonneau and Litman, 1997).

5.1.2 C99 corpus For English, we used the artificial corpus built by Choi (Choi, 2000) for comparing several segmentation systems.

Title:J02-4002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Simone Teufel (Cambridge University, Cambridge UK);Marc Moens (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK)
This is not surprising, given that the definition of our task has little to do with the distribution of content-bearing words and phrases, much less so than the related task of topic segmentation (Morris and Hirst 1991; Hearst 1997; Choi 2000), or Saggion and Lapalmes (2000) approach to the summarization of scientific articles, which relies on scientific concepts and their relations.

Title:J02-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Lev Pevzner (Harvard University, Cambridge MA);Marti A. Hearst (University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley CA)
Some evaluations circumvent this difficulty by detecting boundaries in sets of concatenated documents, where there can be no disagreements about the fact of the matter (Reynar 1994; Choi 2000); others have several human judges make ratings to produce a gold standard. The second difficulty with evaluating these algorithms is that for different applications of text segmentation, different kinds of errors become important.

Title:J02-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Lev Pevzner (Harvard University, Cambridge MA);Marti A. Hearst (University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley CA)
Other techniques use clustering and/or similarity matrices based on word co-occurrences (Reynar 1994; Yaari 1997; Choi 2000), and still others use machine learning techniques to detect cue words, or hand-selected cue words to detect segment boundaries (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty 1997; Manning 1998).

Analysis of the P k Error Metric The P k metric is fast becoming the standard among researchers working in text segmentation (Allan et al. 1998; Dharanipragada et al. 1999; Eichmann et al. 1999; van Mulbregt et al. 1999; Choi 2000).

Title:N03-3009		Conference:Human Language Technologies		Author:Nicola Stokes (University College Dublin, Dublin Ireland)
In (Choi 2000) boundaries are hypothesized using sentences as the basic unit of text; however both C99 and TextTiling can take advantage of paragraph information when the input consists of one paragraph per line.

Title:N03-3009		Conference:Human Language Technologies		Author:Nicola Stokes (University College Dublin, Dublin Ireland)
As explained in Section 3, we determine the effectiveness of our SeLeCT system with respect to two other lexical cohesion based approaches to segmentation, namely the TextTiling (Hearst 1997) and C99 algorithms (Choi 2000)2

Title:N03-3009		Conference:Human Language Technologies		Author:Nicola Stokes (University College Dublin, Dublin Ireland)
In Section 3, we compare the segmentation performance of our lexical chaining algorithm with two other well known lexical cohesion based approaches to segmentation; namely TextTiling (Hearst 1997) and C99 (Choi 2000).

Title:N03-3009		Conference:Human Language Technologies		Author:Nicola Stokes (University College Dublin, Dublin Ireland)
In future experiments we plan to compare SeLeCTs performance on written and spoken news texts with two recently proposed systems, U00 (Utiyama 2001) and CWM (Choi 2001), which have marginally outperformed the C99 algorithm on Chois (2000) test corpus.

4.2 Evaluation We evaluate LCseg against two state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms based on lexical cohesion (Choi, 2000; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001).

While other relations between lexical items also work as cohesive factors (e.g. between a term and its super-ordinate), the work on linear topic segmentation reporting the most promising results account for term repetitions alone (Choi, 2000; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001).

Title:P03-1071		Conference:Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Michel Galley (Columbia University, New York NY);Kathleen R. McKeown (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights NY);Eric Fosler-Lussier;Hongyan Jing
As shown in Table 1, our algorithm is significantly better than (Choi, 2000) (labeled C99) on all three test corpora, according to a one-sided ttest of the null hypothesis of equal mean at the 0.01 level.

Embodiments of this idea include semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), cosine similarity in word vector space (Hearst, 1994), inter-sentence similarity matrix (Reynar, 1994; Choi, 2000), entity repetition (Kan et al. , 1998), word frequency models (Reynar, 1999), or adaptive language models (Beeferman et al. , 1999).

4.1 Components of LetSum Thematic segmentation for which we performed some experiments with two statistic segmenters: one described by Hearst for the TexTiling system (Hearst, 1994) and the C99 segmenter described by Choi (Choi, 2000), both of which apply a clustering function on a document to find classes divided by theme.

Title:H05-1122		Conference:Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing		Author:Andrew Olney (University of Memphis, Memphis TN);Zhiqiang Cai
The first of these, lexical cohesion, may be used for either linear segmentation (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Hearst, 1997) or hierarchical segmentation (Yarri, 1997; Choi, 2000).

Thus, although (Choi, 2000; Hearst, 1997) employ a distance function (i.e. cosine distance) to detect thematic shifts, SVMs are capable of using a larger variety of similarity functions.

Title:W06-2914		Conference:International Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning		Author:Maria Georgescul (University of London-Royal Holloway, Egham UK);Alexander Clark (University of Geneva, Geneva Switzerland);Susan Armstrong
In this manner, (Hearst, 1997; Reynar, 1998; Choi, 2000) start by using a similarity measure between sentences or fixed-size blocks of text, based on their word frequencies in order to find changes in vocabulary use and therefore the points at which the topic changes.

Title:W06-2914		Conference:International Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning		Author:Maria Georgescul (University of London-Royal Holloway, Egham UK);Alexander Clark (University of Geneva, Geneva Switzerland);Susan Armstrong
We compare our system against an existing thematic segmenter in the literature: C99 (Choi, 2000).

Though related to the task of topic segmentation which stimulated a large number of studies (Hearst, 1997; Choi, 2000; Galley et al. , 2003, inter alia), paragraph segmentation has not been thoroughly investigated so far.

Title:J06-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Yves Bestgen (Catholic University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve Belgium)
An 11 11 rank mask was used for the ordinal transformation, as recommended by Choi (2000).

Title:J06-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Yves Bestgen (Catholic University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve Belgium)
4.1 Method The test materials were extracted from the 19971998 corpus following the guidelines given in Choi (2000).

Title:J06-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Yves Bestgen (Catholic University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve Belgium)
For the present experiment, I used the most general test materials built by Choi (2000), in which the size of the segments within each sample varies randomly from 3 to 11 sentences.

Title:J06-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Yves Bestgen (Catholic University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve Belgium)
The major distinction between these methods is in the contrast between the approaches based exclusively on the information contained in the text to be segmented, such as lexical repetition (e.g., Choi 2000; Hearst 1997; Heinonen 1998; Kehagias, Pavlina, and Petridis 2003; Utiyama and Isahara 2001), and those approaches that rest on complementary semantic knowledge extracted from dictionaries and thesauruses (e.g., Kozima 1993; Lin et al. 2004; Morris and Hirst 1991), or from collocations collected in large corpora (Bolshakov and Gelbukh 2001; Brants, Chen, and Tsochantaridis 2002; Choi et al. 2001; Ferret 2002; Kaufmann 1999; Ponte and Croft 1997).

Title:J06-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Yves Bestgen (Catholic University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve Belgium)
The Two Versions of Chois Algorithm The segmentation algorithm proposed by Choi (2000) is made up of the three steps usually found in any segmentation procedure based on lexical cohesion.

Title:J06-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Yves Bestgen (Catholic University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve Belgium)
3.1 Method This experiment was based on the procedure and test materials designed by Choi (2000), which was also used by several authors as a benchmark for comparing segmentation systems (Brants et al. 2002; Ferret 2002; Kehagias et al. 2003; Utiyama and Isahara 2001).

Title:J06-1002		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Yves Bestgen (Catholic University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve Belgium)
The procedure initially proposed by Choi (2000), C99, rests exclusively on the information contained in the text to be segmented.

Previous research has analyzed various facets of lexical distribution, including lexical weighting, similarity computation, and smoothing (Hearst, 1994; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001; Choi, 2000; Reynar, 1998; Kehagias et al. , 2003; Ji and Zha, 2003).

Title:P06-1004		Conference:Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Igor Malioutov (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge MA);Regina Barzilay
For example, most algorithms achieve high performance on synthetic collections, generated by concatenation of random text blocks (Choi, 2000).

0.205 59.00% 62.27 % While most experiments of other authors were taken on short regular-sized segments which was firstly presented by (Choi, 2000), we use comparatively long range of segments, Set 5-20, to evaluate different algorithms.

Title:C08-1103		Conference:International Conference on Computational Linguistics		Author:Veselin Stoyanov (Cornell University, Ithaca NY);Claire Cardie
We use the freely available C99 software described in Choi (2000), varying a parameter that allows us to control the average number of sentences per segment and reporting the best result on the test data.

Title:C08-1103		Conference:International Conference on Computational Linguistics		Author:Veselin Stoyanov (Cornell University, Ithaca NY);Claire Cardie
Existing methods for topic segmentation typically assume that fragments of text (e.g. sentences or sequences of words of a fixed length) with similar lexical distribution are about the same topic; the goal of these methods is to find the boundaries where the lexical distribution changes (e.g. Choi (2000), Malioutov and Barzilay (2006)).

Because the notion of a topic is inherently subjective, we follow many researchers who have reported results on "pseudo-documents"documents formed by concatenating several randomly selected documentsso that the boundaries of segments are known, sharp, and not dependent on annotator variability (Choi, 2000).

However, Galley et al., (Galley et al., 2003) uses only repetition relation as previous research results (e.g., (Choi, 2000)) account only for repetition.

Wikulu currently integrates text segmentation methods such as TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) or C99 (Choi, 2000).

Title:N12-1064		Conference:Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics		Author:Martin Riedl;Christian Biemann
With C99 (Choi, 2000) an algorithm was introduced that uses a matrix-based ranking and aclustering approach in order to relate the most similar textual units and to cluster groups of consecutive units into segments

4.2 C99 using Topic Models For the C99 algorithm (Choi, 2000), named (C99LDA) when using topic IDs, the text is dividedinto minimal units on sentence boundaries

Title:N12-1064		Conference:Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics		Author:Martin Riedl;Christian Biemann
The C99 al gorithm is initialized with a 11?11 ranking mask, asrecommended in Choi (2000)

TT is configured ac cording to Choi (2000) with sequence length w=20 and block size k=6

Title:N12-1064		Conference:Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics		Author:Martin Riedl;Christian Biemann
For evaluation, we rely on the Choi data set (Choi,2000), which has been used in several other text seg mentation approaches to ensure comparability
