This paper describes a method for linear text seg- mentation which is twice as accurate and over seven times as fast as the state-of-the-art (Reynar, 1998). 
Inter-sentence similarity is replaced by rank in the local context. 
Boundary locations are discovered by divisive clustering.
Choi (2000) used the rank of the cosine, rather than the cosine itself, to measure the similarity of sentences.
Other techniques use clustering and/or similarity matrices based on word co-occurrences (Reynar 1994; Yaari 1997; Choi 2000), and still others use machine learning techniques to detect cue words, or hand-selected cue words to detect segment boundaries (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty 1997; Manning 1998).
The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has come up with various solutions towards topic-based text segmentation (e.g. , Hearst, 1994; Choi, 2000; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006).
Improved version of DotPlotting algorithm called C99 (Choi, 2000) uses DotPlotting chart for visualization of similarity measurements at consecutive point of the text (thus resulting in point with different levels of intensity) instead of words cooccurences.
4.2 C99 using Topic Models For the C99 algorithm (Choi, 2000), named (C99LDA) when using topic IDs, the text is dividedinto minimal units on sentence boundaries
The major distinction between these methods is in the contrast between the approaches based exclusively on the information contained in the text to be segmented, such as lexical repetition (e.g., Choi 2000; Hearst 1997; Heinonen 1998; Kehagias, Pavlina, and Petridis 2003; Utiyama and Isahara 2001), and those approaches that rest on complementary semantic knowledge extracted from dictionaries and thesauruses (e.g., Kozima 1993; Lin et al. 2004; Morris and Hirst 1991), or from collocations collected in large corpora (Bolshakov and Gelbukh 2001; Brants, Chen, and Tsochantaridis 2002; Choi et al. 2001; Ferret 2002; Kaufmann 1999; Ponte and Croft 1997).
Traditionally, algorithms for segmentation have relied on textual cues (Hearst, 1997; Miller et al. 1998; Beeferman et al, 1999; Choi, 2000).
With C99 (Choi, 2000) an algorithm was introduced that uses a matrix-based ranking and aclustering approach in order to relate the most similar textual units and to cluster groups of consecutive units into segments
This is not surprising, given that the definition of our task has little to do with the distribution of content-bearing words and phrases, much less so than the related task of topic segmentation (Morris and Hirst 1991; Hearst 1997; Choi 2000), or Saggion and Lapalmes (2000) approach to the summarization of scientific articles, which relies on scientific concepts and their relations.
In (Choi 2000) boundaries are hypothesized using sentences as the basic unit of text; however both C99 and TextTiling can take advantage of paragraph information when the input consists of one paragraph per line.
Because the notion of a topic is inherently subjective, we follow many researchers who have reported results on "pseudo-documents"documents formed by concatenating several randomly selected documentsso that the boundaries of segments are known, sharp, and not dependent on annotator variability (Choi, 2000).
These IDs are used to calculate the cosine similarity between two adjacent blocks of sen tences, represented as two vectors, containing thefrequency of each topic ID. Without parameter opti mization we obtain state-of-the-art results based on the Choi dataset (Choi, 2000)
