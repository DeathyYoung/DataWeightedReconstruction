We present a multi-document summarizer, called MEAD, which generates summaries using cluster centroids produced by a topic detection and tracking system. 
We also describe two new techniques, based on sentence utility and subsumption, which we have applied to the evaluation of both single and multiple document summaries. Among text summarization techniques, there are statistical methods and linguistic methods (Radev et al. , 2000; Marcu et al. , 1999).

3.1 The MEAD summarizer The MEAD summarizer [Radev et al, 2000] [Radev et al 2002] is based on sentence extraction and uses a linear combination of three features to rank the sentences in the source documents. (self citation)
3.1 Evaluation methods We use the Relative Utility (RU) method (Radev et al. , 2000) to compare our various summaries. (self citation)
MEAD (Radev et al. , 2000): MEAD is a centroid-based extractive summarizer that scores sentences based on sentence-level and inter-sentence features which indicate the quality of the sentence as a summary sentence. (self citation)
This is in contrast with a method proposed by Radev (Radev et al. , 2000 ), where the centroid of a cluster is selected as the representative one.
3.2 Extractive Summarizer: MEAD* The extractive approach is represented by MEAD*, which is adapted from the open source summarization framework MEAD (Radev et al., 2000).
Finally, MEAD is a widely used MDS and evaluation platform (Radev et al., 2000).
Sentence clustering has therefore often been used as an early step in MDS (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001; Marcu and Gerber, 2001; Radev et al., 2000).
Co-selection measures include precision and recall of co-selected sentences, relative utility (Radev et al. , 2000), and Kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Carletta, 1996). (self citation)
As in (Radev et al. , 2000), in order to create an extract of a certain length, we simply extract the top scoring sentences that add up to that length. (self citation)
These summarizers have been found to produce quantitatively similar results, and both significantly outperform a baseline summarizer, which is the MEAD summarization framework with all options set to the default (Radev et al., 2000).
The first of these, relative utility (RU) (Radev et al. , 2000) allows model summaries to consist of sentences with variable ranking.
Topic-oriented multi-document summarization has already been studied in other evaluation initiatives which provide testbeds to compare alternative approaches (Over, 2003; Goldstein et al. , 2000; Radev et al. , 2000).
