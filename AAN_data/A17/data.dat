We present a multi-document summarizer, called MEAD, which generates summaries using cluster centroids produced by a topic detection and tracking system. We also describe two new techniques, based on sentence utility and subsumption, which we have applied to the evaluation of both single and multiple document summaries. Finally, we describe two user studies that test our models of multi-document summarization.

Obviously, intrinsic evaluation is more reliable, but it remains an extremely laborious process, where inter-judge disagreement is still an issue, see (Radev et al. , 2000).

First, our method focuses on subject shift of the documents from the target event rather than the sets of documents from dierent events(Radev et al. , 2000).

Among text summarization techniques, there are statistical methods and linguistic methods (Radev et al. , 2000; Marcu et al. , 1999).

3.1 The MEAD summarizer The MEAD summarizer [Radev et al, 2000] [Radev et al 2002] is based on sentence extraction and uses a linear combination of three features to rank the sentences in the source documents. (self citation)

Title:J02-4001		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Radev, Dragomir R.; Hovy, Eduard; McKeown, Kathleen R.
But the interpretation of the results is not simple; studies (Jing et al. 1998; Donaway, Drummey, and Mather 2000; Radev, Jing, and Budzikowska 2000) 404 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 4 show how the same summaries receive different scores under different measures or when compared to different (but presumably equivalent) ideal summaries created by humans. (self citation)

Title:J02-4001		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Radev, Dragomir R.; Hovy, Eduard; McKeown, Kathleen R.
A common approach is to measure similarity between all pairs of sentences and then use clustering to identify themes of common information (McKeown et al. 1999; Radev, Jing, and Budzikowska 2000; Marcu and Gerber 2001). (self citation)

Title:J02-4001		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Radev, Dragomir R.; Hovy, Eduard; McKeown, Kathleen R.
Other research rewards passages that include topic words, that is, words that have been determined to correlate well with the topic of interest to the user (for topic-oriented summaries) or with the general theme of the source text (Buckley and Cardie 1997; Strzalkowski et al. 1999; Radev, Jing, and Budzikowska 2000). (self citation)

Title:W03-0503		Conference:Workshop On Text Summarization		Author:Grewal, Amardeep; Allison, Timothy; Dimitrov, Stanko; Radev, Dragomir R.
A number of techniques for choosing the right sentences to extract have been proposed in the literature, ranging from word counts (Luhn, 1958), key phrases (Edmundson, 1969), naive Bayesian classification (Kupiec et al. , 1995), lexical chains (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997), topic signatures (Hovy and Lin, 1999) and cluster centroids (Radev et al. , 2000).

3.1 Evaluation methods We use the Relative Utility (RU) method (Radev et al. , 2000) to compare our various summaries. (self citation)

However, this experiment differs from prior work in that we use judges to determine the relevance of sentences to sub-events rather than to evaluate summaries (Radev et al. , 2000). (self citation)

Title:W03-0502		Conference:Workshop On Text Summarization		Author:Daniel, Naomi; Radev, Dragomir R.; Allison, Timothy
It allows us to distinguish the degree of importance between sentences, providing a more flexible model for evaluating sentence utility (Radev et al. , 2000). (self citation)

Three judges have assessed the sentences in each cluster and have provided a score on a scale from 0 to 10 (i.e. utility judgement), expressing how important the sentence is for the topic of the cluster (Radev et al., 2000).

MEAD (Radev et al. , 2000): MEAD is a centroid-based extractive summarizer that scores sentences based on sentence-level and inter-sentence features which indicate the quality of the sentence as a summary sentence. (self citation)

As in (Radev et al. , 2000), in order to create an extract of a certain length, we simply extract the top scoring sentences that add up to that length. (self citation)

Co-selection measures include precision and recall of co-selected sentences, relative utility (Radev et al. , 2000), and Kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Carletta, 1996). (self citation)

This is in contrast with a method proposed by Radev (Radev et al. , 2000 ), where the centroid of a cluster is selected as the representative one.

Topic-oriented multi-document summarization has already been studied in other evaluation initiatives which provide testbeds to compare alternative approaches (Over, 2003; Goldstein et al. , 2000; Radev et al. , 2000).

MEAD research efforts have resulted in significant contributions to support the development of summarization applications (Radev et al., 2000).

Title:C08-1023		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Chica, Sebastian; Ahmad, Faisal; Martin, James H.; Sumner, Tamara
We have designed and implemented an extractive summarizer for educational science content, called COGENT, based on MEAD version 3.11 (Radev et al., 2000).

Finally, MEAD is a widely used multi-document summarization and evaluation platform (Radev et al., 2000).

Title:W08-1106		Conference:Proceedings of the Fifth International Natural Language Generation Conference		Author:Carenini, Giuseppe; Cheung, Jackie Chi Kit
These summarizers have been found to produce quantitatively similar results, and both significantly outperform a baseline summarizer, which is the MEAD summarization framework with all options set to the default (Radev et al., 2000).

3.2 Extractive Summarizer: MEAD* The extractive approach is represented by MEAD*, which is adapted from the open source summarization framework MEAD (Radev et al., 2000).

Finally, MEAD is a widely used MDS and evaluation platform (Radev et al., 2000).

Title:P09-1024		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Sauper, Christina; Barzilay, Regina
This strategy is commonly used in multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999; Goldstein et al., 2000; Radev et al., 2000), where the combination step eliminates the redundancy across selected excerpts.

Title:W09-1801		Conference:Proceedings of the Workshop on Integer Linear Programming for Natural Language Processing		Author:Martins, Andre; Smith, Noah A.
In the last two decades, machine learning techniques have been employed in extractive summarization of single documents (Kupiec et al., 1995; Aone et al., 1999; Osborne, 2002) and multiple documents (Radev and McKeown, 1998; Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Radev et al., 2000).

Title:P09-3012		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP: Student Research Workshop papers		Author:Geiss, Johanna
Sentence clustering has therefore often been used as an early step in MDS (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001; Marcu and Gerber, 2001; Radev et al., 2000).

Title:C10-1039		Conference:COLING		Author:Ganesan, Kavita; Zhai, ChengXiang; Han, Jiawei
Thus, we use MEAD (Radev et al., 2000) as our baseline.
