In order to realize the full potential ofdependency-based syntactic parsing, it isdesirable to allow non-projective depen-dency structures. We show how a data-driven deterministic dependency parser,in itself restricted to projective structures,can be combined with graph transforma-tion techniques to produce non-projectivestructures. Experiments using data fromthe Prague Dependency Treebank showthat the combined system can handle non-projective constructions with a precisionsufficient to yield a significant improve-ment in overall parsing accuracy. Thisleads to the best reported performance forrobust non-projective parsing of Czech.

An alternative method, used by Charniak in the adaptation of his parser for Czech 6 and used by Nivre and Nilsson (2005), alters the dependency links by raising the governor to a higher node in the tree whenever 5 Bilexical dependencies are components of both the Collins and Charniak parsers and effectively model the types of syntactic subordination that we wish to extract in a dependency tree.

Most of this work has so far focused either on post-processing to recover non-local dependencies from context-free parse trees (Johnson, 2002; Jijkoun and De Rijke, 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004; Campbell, 2004), or on incorporating nonlocal dependency information in nonterminal categories in constituency representations (Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Hockenmaier, 2003; Cahill et al. , 2004) or in the categories used to label arcs in dependency representations (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005). (self citation)

Title:E06-1010		Conference:Conference Of The European Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Nivre, Joakim
It should be noted that the proportion of lost dependencies is about twice as high as the proportion of dependencies that are non-projective in themselves (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005). (self citation)

You could map a non-projective dependency tree to a projective one, learn and predict the tree, then bring it back to the non-projective dependency tree (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).

4 Non-Projective Relations For handling non-projective relations, Nivre and Nilsson (2005) suggested applying a preprocessing step to a dependency parser, which consists in lifting non-projective arcs to their head repeatedly, until the tree becomes pseudo-projective.

We see that pseudo-projective parsing brings a very consistent increase in accuracy of at least 1.5 percentage points, which is more than that reported by Nivre and Nilsson (2005), and that the addition of the PS-to-MS transformations increases accuracy with about the same margin. (self citation)

However, recent results in non-projective dependency parsing, especially using data-driven methods, indicate that most non-projective structures required for the analysis of natural language are very nearly projective, differing only minimally from the best projective approximation (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Novk, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).

4.3 Discussion As a general result, our experiments confirm previous studies on non-projective dependency parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Novk, 2005; 512 McDonald and Pereira, 2006): The phenomenon of non-projectivity cannot be ignored without also ignoring a significant portion of real-world data (around 15a37for DDT, and 23a37for PDT).

The pseudo-projective approach (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005): Transform non-projective training trees to projective ones but encode the information necessary to make the inverse transformation in the DEPREL, so that this inverse transformation can also be carried out on the test trees (Nivre et al. , 2006).

We projectivize training data by a minimal transformation, lifting non-projective arcs one step at a time, and extending the arc label of lifted arcs using the encoding scheme called HEAD by Nivre and Nilsson (2005), which means that a lifted arc is assigned the label rh, where r is the original label and h is the label of the original head in the nonprojective dependency graph.

To avoid too small training sets, we pool together categories that have a frequency below a certain threshold t. 2.4 Pseudo-Projective Parsing Pseudo-projective parsing was proposed by Nivre and Nilsson (2005) as a way of dealing with non-projective structures in a projective data-driven parser.

We will focus on tree transformations that combine preprocessing with post-processing, and where the parser is treated as a black box, such as the pseudo-projective parsing technique proposed by Nivre and Nilsson (2005) and the tree transformations investigated in Nilsson et al. (self citation)

The first thing to note is that pseudo-projective parsing gives a significant improvement for PDT, as previously reported by Nivre and Nilsson (2005), but also for Alpino, where the improvement is even larger, presumably because of the higher proportion of non-projective dependencies in the Dutch treebank. (self citation)

Corresponding manipulations in the form of tree transformations for dependency-based parsers have recently gained more interest (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Novak, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nilsson et al. , 2006) but are still less studied, partly because constituency-based parsing has dominated the field for a long time, and partly because dependency structures have less structure to manipulate than constituent structures.

Finally, in contrast to the results reported by Nivre and Nilsson (2005), simply projectivizing the training data (without using an inverse transformation) is not beneficial at all, except possibly for Alpino. (self citation)

Sincetheparsingalgorithmonlyproducesprojective dependency graphs, we may use pseudo-projective parsing to recover non-projective dependencies, i.e., projectivize training data and encode information about these transformations in extended arc labels to support deprojectivization of the parser output (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).

The most popular strategy for capturing nonprojective structures in data-driven dependency parsing is to apply some kind of post-processing to the output of a strictly projective dependency parser, as in pseudo-projective parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), corrective modeling (Hall and Novak, 2005), or approximate non-projective parsing (McDonald and Pereira, 2006).

1 Introduction Parsing technologies have improved considerably in the past few years, and high-performance syntactic parsers are no longer limited to PCFG-based frameworks (Charniak, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2003; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov and Klein, 2007), but also include dependency parsers (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007) and deep parsers (Kaplan et al., 2004; Clark and Curran, 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2008).

To simplify implementation, we instead opted for the pseudo-projective approach (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), in which nonprojective links are lifted upwards in the tree to achieve projectivity, and special trace labels are used to enable recovery of the nonprojective links at parse time.

Title:J08-4003		Conference:Computational Linguistics		Author:Nivre, Joakim
In order to make the comparison more fair, we therefore also evaluate pseudo-projective versions of the latter algorithms, making use of graph transformations in pre-and post-processing to recover nonprojective dependency arcs, following Nivre and Nilsson (2005). (self citation)

Nivre and Nilsson (2005) observe that most non-projective dependency structures appearing in practice are close to being projective, since they contain only a small proportion of nonprojective arcs.

However, just as it has been noted that most non-projective structures appearing in practice are only slightly nonprojective (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), we characterise a sense in which the structures appearing in treebanks can be viewed as being only slightly ill-nested.

Some authors propose to solve it by techniques for recovering non-projectivity from the output of a projective parser in a post-processing step (Hall and Novk, 2005; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), others extend projective parsers by heuristics that allow at least certain non-projective constructions to be parsed (Attardi, 2006; Nivre, 2007).

The first is simplicity, given that it is based on a single transition system and makes a single pass over the input, whereas the pseudo-projective parsing technique involves preprocessing of training data and post-processing of parser output (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005). (self citation)

However, we have found this not to be a problem when measuring multiplanarity in natural language treebanks, since the effective problem size can be reduced by noting that each connected component of the crossings graph can be treated separately, and that nodes that are not part of a cycle need not be considered.5 Given that non-projective sentences in natural language tend to have a small proportion of non-projective links (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), the connected components of their crossings graphs are very small, and k-colourings for them can quickly be found by brute-force search.

As our baseline, we take the strictly projective arc-eager transition system proposed by Nivre (2003), as implemented in the freely available MaltParser system (Nivre et al., 2006a), with and without the pseudo-projective parsing technique for recovering non-projective dependencies (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).

Before training the classification models, we projectivized the corpus sentences (Kunze, 1967; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).

Different ways have been proposed to deal with non-projectivity (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nivre, 2009).

Since the number of non-projective dependencies is much smaller than the number of projective dependencies (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), it is not efficient to perform non-projective parsing for all cases.

An alternative to this approach is to use transitionbased parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Attardi, 2006; Nivre, 2009; Gomez-Rodrguez and Nivre, 2010), where there is an incremental processing of a string with a model that scores transitions between parser states, conditioned on the parse history.
