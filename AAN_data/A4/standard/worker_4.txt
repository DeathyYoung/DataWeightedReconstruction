We describe in this t)at)er a method for au- tomatically training tel)it, signatures--sets of related words, with associated weights, organized around head topics and illustrate with signatm'es we cre- ;tt
First of all, when a summary in question contains sentences that do not appear in any of the model extracts, one may not be sure that those sentences are uninformative or inappropriate for inclusion in a summary
Two methods are used: topic signature (Lin and Hovy, 2000): a topic signature is a family of related terms {topic, signature}, where topic is the target concept and signature is a vecto related s
In summarization, such words are called signature terms and are thought to be descriptive of the input; they can be identified using the log-likelihood ratio of each word (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Gupta et al
We implemented a topicrelated headline generator based on our previous work (Lin and Hovy, 2000) by incorporating a topic-based selector
Such words are called signature terms in Lin and Hovy (2000) who were the first to introduce the log-likelihood weighting scheme for summarization
In summarization, topic signatures are a set of terms indicative of a topic (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
(2005), which uses Topic Signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) constructed around the target individuals name to identify sentences to be included in the biography
The idea of topic signature terms was introduced by Lin and Hovy (Lin and Hovy, 2000) in the context of single document summarization, and was later used in several multi-document summarization systems (Conroy et al
In addition, infobox could be considered as topic signature (Lin and Hovy, 2000) or keywords about the topic
, 2004) and signature term (Lin and Hovy, 2000) are most remarkable
2 Automatically retrieved Topic Signatures Topic Signatures (TS) are word vectors related to a particular topic (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
Using these sets we obtained a set of Topic Signatures (TS) (Lin and Hovy, 2000) for the Spanish geography domain and another set of TS for the non-Spanish geography domain
In order to generate QUABs automatically, documents identified from FERRETs automatic Q/A system are first submitted to a Topic Representation module, which computes both topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and enhanced topic signatures (Harabagiu, 2004) in order to identify a set of topic-relevant passages
Our next steps will be to take a closer look at the following work: clustering of similar words (Lin, 1998), topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and Kilgariffs sketch engine (Kilgarriff et al
