Topic Signatures Topic Signatures (TS) are word vectors related to a particular topic (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
Vectors contain only topic signatures from the input and all words of the summary Topic signatures are words highly descriptive of the input, as determined by the application of loglikelihood test (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
Two methods are used: topic signature (Lin and Hovy, 2000): a topic signature is a family of related terms {topic, signature}, where topic is the target concept and signature is a vecto related s
In summarization, such words are called signature terms and are thought to be descriptive of the input; they can be identified using the log-likelihood ratio of each word (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Gupta et al
We implemented a topicrelated headline generator based on our previous work (Lin and Hovy, 2000) by incorporating a topic-based selector
To date, researchers have harvested, with varying success, several resources, including concept lists (Lin and Pantel 2002), topic signatures (Lin and Hovy 2000), facts (Etzioni et al
Under this approach, topic representations like those introduced in (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and (Harabagiu, 2004) are used to identify a set of text passages that are relevant to a users domain of interest
The idea of topic signature terms was introduced by Lin and Hovy (Lin and Hovy, 2000) in the context of single document summarization, and was later used in several multi-document summarization systems (Conroy et al
In addition, infobox could be considered as topic signature (Lin and Hovy, 2000) or keywords about the topic
For single document summarization, the sentence score is usually computed by empirical combination of a number of statistical and linguistic feature values, such as term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (Luhn 1969; Lin and Hovy, 2000)
In the task of single document summarization, various features have been investigated for ranking sentences in a document, including term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, and topic signature (Luhn 1969; Lin and Hovy, 2000)
The categories are learned in a semi-supervised way based on syntactic and semantic functions, such as suggestion dents papers using topic signature (Lin and Hovy, 2000) software kindly provided by Annie Louis
Lin and Hovy (2000) describe a Topic Signature as a list of words highly correlated with a target concept, and use a 2 estimator over labeled data to decide as to the allocation of a word to a topic
These n-gram key concepts are called topic signatures (Lin and Hovy 2000)
Other systems exploit the co-occurrence of particular concepts (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Lin and Hovy, 2000) or syntactic constraints between concepts (McKeown et al
