2 Automatically retrieved Topic Signatures Topic Signatures (TS) are word vectors related to a particular topic (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
Using these sets we obtained a set of Topic Signatures (TS) (Lin and Hovy, 2000) for the Spanish geography domain and another set of TS for the non-Spanish geography domain
In order to generate QUABs automatically, documents identified from FERRETs automatic Q/A system are first submitted to a Topic Representation module, which computes both topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and enhanced topic signatures (Harabagiu, 2004) in order to identify a set of topic-relevant passages
1 Topic Signatures Topic Signatures (TS) are word vectors related to a particular topic (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
1 Sense Representation For clustering purposes, word senses are represented as topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
2 Topic Signatures Topic Signatures (TS) are word vectors related to a particular topic (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
Therefore, even if a summary contains sentences found in one or more reference summaries, it does not always mean that it is advisable to include those sentences in the summary in question
Two methods are used: topic signature (Lin and Hovy, 2000): a topic signature is a family of related terms {topic, signature}, where topic is the target concept and signature is a vecto related s
In summarization, such words are called signature terms and are thought to be descriptive of the input; they can be identified using the log-likelihood ratio of each word (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Gupta et al
We implemented a topicrelated headline generator based on our previous work (Lin and Hovy, 2000) by incorporating a topic-based selector
 Machine learning methods have also been employed to extract sentences, including unsupervised methods (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 2001) and supervised methods (Kupiec et al
The scores are usually computed based on a combination of statistical and linguistic features, including term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (Hovy and Lin, 1997; Lin and Hovy, 2000), etc
Lin and Hovy (2000) identified signature terms that were strongly associated with documents based on statistics measures
A topic signature, as described in (Lin and Hovy, 2000), is a list of terms that can be used to signal the membership of a text in the relevant topic or category
Vectors contain only topic signatures from the input and all words of the summary Topic signatures are words highly descriptive of the input, as determined by the application of loglikelihood test (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
