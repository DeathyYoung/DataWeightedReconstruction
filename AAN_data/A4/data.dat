In order to produce, a good summary, one has to identify the most relevant portions of a given text. We describe in this t)at)er a method for au- tomatically training tel)it, signatures--sets of related words, with associated weights, organized around head topics and illustrate with signatm'es we cre- ;tt.ed with 6,194 TREC collection texts over 4 se- lected tot)ics. We descril)e the l)ossible integration of' tolli(: signatures with ontoh)gies and its evaluaton on an automate(l text summarization system.

A topic signature, as described in (Lin and Hovy, 2000), is a list of terms that can be used to signal the membership of a text in the relevant topic or category. (self citation)

We implemented the algorithm described in (Lin and Hovy, 2000) with the addition of a cutoff, such that the topic signatures for a term are only included if the p1/p2 for that term is greater than the mean p1/p2 over all terms. (self citation)

Two methods are used: topic signature (Lin and Hovy, 2000): a topic signature is a family of related terms {topic, signature}, where topic is the target concept and signature is a vecto related s. The topic in e formula is assigned with the domain e. To nstruct the set of related words, we consider N 2 N 3 N 1 e s E 2 E 3 E 1 Figure 3. (self citation)

2 General Summarization Model Many summarization systems (e.g. , (Teufel and Moens, 1997; McKeown et al. , 1999; Lin and Hovy, 2000)) include two levels of analysis: the sentence level, where every textual unit is scored according to c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 t1 1 1 0 1 1 t2 1 0 0 1 0 t3 0 1 0 0 1 t4 1 0 1 1 1 Table 1: Matrix for Summarization Model the concepts or features it covers, and the text level, where, before being added to the final output, textual units are compared to each other on the basis of those features.

sembled, topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Harabagiu 2004) are computed which identify the set of topic-relevant concepts and relations between concepts that are found in the relevant set of documents.

Title:W06-3004		Conference:Interactive Question Answering Workshop		Author:Hickl, Andrew; Harabagiu, Sanda M.
In order to generate QUABs automatically, documents identified from FERRETs automatic Q/A system are first submitted to a Topic Representation module, which computes both topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and enhanced topic signatures (Harabagiu, 2004) in order to identify a set of topic-relevant passages.

The scores are usually computed based on a combination of statistical and linguistic features, including term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (Hovy and Lin, 1997; Lin and Hovy, 2000), etc. Machine learning methods have also been employed to extract sentences, including unsupervised methods (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 2001) and supervised methods (Kupiec et al. , 1995; Conroy and OLeary, 2001; Amini and Gallinari, 2002; Shen et al. , 2007).

First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al. , 2006; Vanderwende et al. , 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al. , 2006; Lacatusu et al. , 2006).

Title:P08-1090		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Chambers, Nathanael; Jurafsky, Daniel

The idea of topic signature terms was introduced by Lin and Hovy (Lin and Hovy, 2000) in the context of single document summarization, and was later used in several multi-document summarization systems (Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2004; Gupta et al., 2007).

6.3ComparingtheMachine-MadeSummariesandtheManuallyCreatedExtracts Measuring sentence co-selection between extractive summaries created by humans and those created by automatic summarizers has a long tradition in the text summarization community (Lin and Hovy 2000; Marcu 2000), but this family of measures has a number of well-known shortcomings.As many have remarked on previous occasions (Mani 2001; Radev et al.2003), co-selection measures do not provide a complete assessment of the quality of a summary.First of all, when a summary in question contains sentences that do not appear in any of the model extracts, one may not be sure that those sentences are uninformative or inappropriate for inclusion in a summary.In addition, documents have internal discourse structure and sentences are often inter-dependent.Therefore, even if a summary contains sentences found in one or more reference summaries, it does not always mean that it is advisable to include those sentences in the summary in question.

While there is shortage of some document types needed, there are nevertheless quite a few sources one may consider to begin with: Wikipedia, domain taxonomies, topic signatures, (Lin and Hovy, 2000), a database like (http://openrdf.org), etc. Topic sensitivity Weights are important, but they tend to change dynamically with time and the topic.

Title:P10-1094		Conference:ACL		Author:Wan, Xiaojun; Li, Huiying; Xiao, Jianguo
For single document summarization, the sentence score is usually computed by empirical combination of a number of statistical and linguistic feature values, such as term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (Luhn 1969; Lin and Hovy, 2000).

Title:N10-2002		Conference:Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010 Demonstration Session		Author:Cai, Congxing; Hovy, Eduard

It is therefore important to deploy topic recognition (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and/or topic clustering (Osinski and Weiss, 2005) to identify and group relevant pieces of each text into single-topic chunks. (self citation)

Lin and Hovy (2000) describe a Topic Signature as a list of words highly correlated with a target concept, and use a 2 estimator over labeled data to decide as to the allocation of a word to a topic.

The discriminative power of a term with respect to node N is formalized based on one of the following measures: Entropy of the a posteriori children category distribution for a given w. Ent(w) = summationdisplay CSub(N) p(C|w)log(p(C|w) (3) Cross-Entropy between the a priori children category distribution and the a posteriori children categories distribution conditioned on the appearance of w. CrossEnt(w) = summationdisplay CSub(N) p(C)log(p(C|w)) (4) 2 score, similar to Lin and Hovy (2000) but applied to classification tasks that can involve an arbitrary number of (sub-)categories.

Lastly, while most recent developments have been based on unsupervised data, it is also worth mentioning earlier approaches like Topic Signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) where words (or phrases) characteristic of a topic are identified using a statistical test of dependence.

Title:P11-2088		Conference:Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies		Author:Xiong, Wenting; Litman, Diane J.
