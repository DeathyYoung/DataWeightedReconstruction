Also, dependency parsers are not significantly better at recovering head-based dependencies than constituent parsers based on the PTB (McDonald et al
Corpus preprocessing is done as the following: sentence segmentation was performed using the tool from CCG group at UIUC 1; words are then tokenized and tagged with part-of-speech using MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and dependency parsing is performed using MSTParser (McDonald et al
6 Discussion The well-formed dependency structures defined here are similar to the data structures in previous work on mono-lingual parsing (Eisner and Satta, 1999; McDonald et al
Alternatively, discriminative parsing is tractable with exact and efficient search based on dynamic programming (DP) if all features are restricted to be local, that is, only looking at a local window within the factored search space (Taskar et al
Moreover, we train a first-order projective dependency parser with MSTParser5 (McDonald et al
In fact, some structured prediction algorithms, such as the MIRA algorithm used in dependency parsing (McDonald et al
It uses online large margin learning as the learning algorithm (McDonald et al
In the second category are those that employ exhaustive inference algorithms, usually by making strong independence assumptions, as is the case for edge-factored models (Paskin, 2001; McDonald et al
However, global constraints cannot be incorporated into the CLE algorithm (McDonald et al
, 2007) was used to POS tag the source sentencesand the parses were obtained using the first order MST parser (McDonald et al
Parsing is performed using the usual pipeline approach, first with the TreeTagger analyzer (Schmid, 1994) and then with a state-of-the-art dependency parser (McDonald et al
Thus, transition-based parsers normally run in linear or quadratic time, using greedy deterministic search or fixed-width beam search (Nivre et al
Two representative methods for dependency parsing are transitionbased model like MaltParser (Nivre, 2003) and graph-based model like MSTParser 1 (McDonald et al
The training algorithm we propose in this paper is based on the K-best MIRA algorithm which has been used earlier in structured prediction problems (McDonald et al
Penn Treebank was previously used to train and evaluate various dependency parsers (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; McDonald et al
