We describe a practical parser for unre- stricted dependencies. The parser creates links between words and names the links according to their syntactic functions. We first describe the older Constraint Gram- mar parser where many of the ideas come from. Then we proceed to describe the cen- tral ideas of our new parser. Finally, the parser is evaluated.

In contrast, dependency schemes (e.g. , Sleator and Temperley, 1993; Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997; Carroll, et al. , forthcoming) do not 3 http://www.cis.upenn.edu/treebank provide a constituency analysis4 but rather specify grammatical relations among elements explicitly; for example, the sentence Paul intends to leave IBM could be represented as shown in Figure 2, where the predicate is the relation type, the first argument is the head, the second the dependent, and additional arguments may provide category-specific information (e.g. , introducer for prepositional phrases, etc.).

The present paper offers a similarity1With the exception of dependency-grammar-based parsers (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997; Broker et al. , 1994; Lesmo and Lombardo, 2000), where functional labels are treated as first-class citizens as relations between words, and recent work on a semi-automatic method for treebank construction (Brants et al. , 1997), little has been reported on based algorithm for assigning functional labels such as subject, object, head, complement, etc. to complete syntactic structures on the basis of pre-chunked input.

In order to determine the head of noun phrases we use the FDG tagger (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997) which also provides partial dependency relations between the constituents of a sentence.

Additionally we used head-noun features that were obtained from preanalysis of the training data set using the FDG shallow parser from Conexor (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997).

The two grammar systems to compare are Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) and the Conexor Functional Dependency Grammar parser (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997) (henceforth referred to as Conexor FDG).

The rules for linking dependents to heads can specify constraints on the intervening material between them, so that, for instance, certain links may be prevented from crossing barriers such as punctuation or lexical items with certain parts of speech or morphological properties (Collins 1996; Giguet and Vergne 1997; Tapanainen and Jarvinen 1997).

4.2 Generating Dependency Patterns Three dependency parsers were used for these experiments: MINIPAR3 (Lin, 1999), the Machinese Syntax4 parser from Connexor Oy (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997) and the Stanford5 parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).

We start by parsing the corpus with a dependency parser (we use Connexors FDG (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997)), treating every verb with its dependent constituents as a clause.

Length in characters), calculated based on linguistic pre-processing made with the English Functional Dependency Grammar (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997) (e.g., Case, Part-of-speech), fetched from precompiled lists of information (e.g., Is first name?), and features based on predictions concerning the context of the token (e.g, Class of previous token).

The anaphora resolution module only handles rst and third person singular personal pronouns (I,me,my,he,his) and singular denite noun phrases that denote animate entities (e.g., the man,butnotmen).It is implemented in Java, within the GATE framework, using the Connexor Machinese Syntax parser (Tapanainen and Jarvinen 1997).

The first constraint potentially simplifies dependency parsing, and non-projective dependencies are relatively well understood in the dependency parsing community (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997; McDonald et al., 2005).
