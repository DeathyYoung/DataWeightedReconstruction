Title:W05-1203		Conference:Workshop On Empirical Modeling Of Semantic Equivalence And Entailment		Author:Corley, Courtney D.; Mihalcea, Rada
This paper presents a knowledge-basedmethod for measuring the semantic-similarity of texts. While there is a largebody of previous work focused on find-ing the semantic similarity of conceptsand words, the application of these word-oriented methods to text similarity has notbeen yet explored. In this paper, we in-troduce a method that combines word-to-word similarity metrics into a text-to-text metric, and we show that this methodoutperforms the traditional text similaritymetrics based on lexical matching.

It has already been applied in this way by Corley & Mihalcea (2005) and Wu (2005).

Second, we can use one of the WordNet (Miller, 1995) similarities indicated with d(lw,lwprime) (in line with what was done in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005)) and different relation between words such as the lexical entailment between verbs (Ent) and derivationally relation between words (Der).

The above word similarity measure can be used to compute the similarity between T and H. In line with (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005), we define it as: s1(T,H) = summationdisplay (wt,wh)A simw(wt,wh)idf(wh) summationdisplay whWH idf(wh) (3) where idf(w) is the inverse document frequency of the word w. For sake of comparison, we consider also the corresponding more classical version that does not apply the inverse document frequency s2(T,H) = summationdisplay (wt,wh)A simw(wt,wh)/|WH| (4) From the above intra-pair similarities, s1 and s2, we can obtain the baseline cross-pair similarities based on only lexical information: Ki((Tprime,Hprime),(Tprimeprime,Hprimeprime)) = si(Tprime,Hprime)si(Tprimeprime,Hprimeprime), (5) where i {1,2}.

A first class of methods defines measures of the distance or similarity between T and H either assuming the independence between words (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Glickman et al. , 2005) in a bag-of-word fashion or exploiting syntactic interpretations (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005).

For example, the sentence T1: At the end of the year, all solid companies pay dividends. entails the hypothesis H1: At the end of the year, all solid insurance companies pay dividends. but it does not entail the hypothesis H2: At the end of the year, all solid companies pay cash dividends. Although these implications are uncontroversial, their automatic recognition is complex if we rely on models based on lexical distance (or similarity) between hypothesis and text, e.g., (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005).

Third, the dramatic improvement observed in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) on the dataset Train:D1-Test:T1 is given by the idf rather than the use of the J&C similarity (second vs. third columns).

Our approach is in line with many other researches (e.g. , (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Glickman et al. , 2005)).

Also, we will try different similarity score functions for both the clustering and the anchor approaches, as those surveyed in Corley and Mihalcea (2005).

We also used the following resources: the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) to carry out the syntactic analysis; the wn::similaritypackage (Pedersen et al. , 2004) to compute the Jiang&Conrath (J&C) distance (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) needed to implement the lexical similarity siml(T,H) as defined in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005); SVM-lightTK (Moschitti, 2004) to encode the basic tree kernel function, KT, in SVM-light (Joachims, 1999).

Then, we use this cross-pair similarity with more traditional intra-pair similarities (e.g. , (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005)) to define a novel kernel function.

First, as observed in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) the lexical-based distance kernel Kl shows an accuracy significantly higher than the random baseline, i.e. 50%.

In line with many other researches (e.g. , (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005)), we determine these anchors using different similarity or relatedness dectors: the exact matching between tokens or lemmas, a similarity between tokens based on their edit distance, the derivationally related form relation and the verb entailment relation in WordNet, and, finally, a WordNet-based similarity (Jiang and Conrath, 1997).

On the other hand, Corley and Mihalcea (2005) found little difference between the measures when using them in an algorithm for computing text similarity.

The classifier uses as the only feature the lexical overlap similarity score described in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005); -lex+tap: these configurations mix lexical overlap and our typed anchor approaches; -lex+tree: the comparison of this configuration with lex+tap should further support the validity of our intuition on typed anchors; Preliminary experiments have been performed using two datasets: RTE2 (the 1600 entailment pairs from the RTE-2 challenge) and RTE3d (the development dataset of this challenge).

Several models, ranging from the simple lexical similarity between T and H to advanced Logic Form Representations, have been proposed (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Glickman and Dagan, 2004; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005).

Such overlap features give the best-published classification accuracy for the paraphrase identification task (Zhang and Patrick, 2005; Finch et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2006; Corley and Mihalcea, 2005, inter alia), but do not explicitly model correspondence structure (or alignment) between the parts of two sentences.

As noted, the most successful work has used edit distance (Zhang and Patrick, 2005) or bag-of-words features to measure sentence similarity, along with shallow syntactic features (Finch et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2006; Corley and Mihalcea, 2005).

In practice, we implement WBOW by using the text similarity measure defined in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) as the single feature in the SVM classifier that, as in BOW, learns the threshold on this single feature.
