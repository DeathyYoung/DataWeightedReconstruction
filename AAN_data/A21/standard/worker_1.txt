This paper presents a knowledge-based method for measuring the semantic-similarity of texts. 
While there is a large body of previous work focused on find-ing the semantic similarity of conceptsand words, the application of these word-oriented methods to text similarity has not been yet explored. 
In this paper, we in-troduce a method that combines word-to-word similarity metrics into a text-to-text metric, and we show that this method outperforms the traditional text similarity metrics based on lexical matching.
The above word similarity measure can be used to compute the similarity between T and H. A first class of methods defines measures of the distance or similarity between T and H either assuming the independence between words (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Glickman et al. , 2005) in a bag-of-word fashion or exploiting syntactic interpretations (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005).
Three main classes of features have been so far explored in RTE: distance/similarity feature spaces (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Newman et al., 2005; Haghighi et al., 2005; Hickl et al., 2006), Corley and Mihalcea (2005) proposed a hybrid method by combining six existing knowledge-based methods. trigger feature spaces (de Marneffe et al., 2006; MacCartney et al., 2006), and pair content feature spaces (Zanzotto et al., 2009).
In practice, we implement WBOW by using the text similarity measure defined in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) as the single feature in the SVM classifier that, as in BOW, learns the threshold on this single feature.efined in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) as the single feature in the SVM classifier that, as in BOW, learns the threshold on this single feature.

First, as observed in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) the lexical-based distance kernel Kl shows an accuracy significantly higher than the random baseline, i.e. 50%.
Then, we use this cross-pair similarity with more traditional intra-pair similarities (e.g. , (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005)) to define a novel kernel function.
Paraphrase Recognition and Textual Entailment A problem closely related to, and as important as, generating paraphrases is that of assigning a quantitative measurement to the semantic similarity of two phrases (Fujita and Sato 2008a) or even two given pieces of text (Corley and Mihalcea 2005; Uzuner and Katz 2005).
For example, Corley and Mihalcea (2005) consider the ontological distance between the conceptsrepresentingthetextsbutignoretheirdistributionalinformation.Ontheother hand,ScottandMatwin(1998),McCarthy(2000),andMohammadandHirst(2006)take the distributional distance between concept vectors representing the texts but do not considertheontologicalrelationsamongtheconcepts.
This simple feature is the lexical similarity between T andH computed using WordNet-based metrics as in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005).

Several models, ranging from the simple lexical similarity between T and H to advanced Logic Form Representations, have been proposed (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Glickman and Dagan, 2004; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005).
