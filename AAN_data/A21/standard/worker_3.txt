ased method for measuring the semantic-similarity of texts. 
While there is a large body of previous work focused on find-ing the semantic similarity of conceptsand words, the application of these word-oriented methods to text similarity has not been yet explored. 
In this paper, we in-troduce a method that combines word-to-word similarity metrics into a text-to-text metric, and we show that this method outperforms the traditional text similarity metrics based on lexical matching.
Second, we can use one of the WordNet (Miller, 1995) similarities indicated with d(lw,lwprime) (in line with what was done in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005)) and different relation between words such as the lexical entailment between verbs (Ent) and derivationally relation between words (Der).
A first class of methods defines measures of the distance or similarity between T and H either assuming the independence between words (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Glickman et al. , 2005) in a bag-of-word fashion or exploiting syntactic interpretations (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005).
Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied heuristic formu10 las to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms.
Three main classes of features have been so far explored in RTE: distance/similarity feature spaces (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Newman et al., 2005; Haghighi et al., 2005; Hickl et al., 2006), entailment trigger feature spaces (de Marneffe et al., 2006; MacCartney et al., 2006), and pair content feature spaces (Zanzotto et al., 2009).
Corley and Mihalcea (2005) proposed a hybrid method by combining six existing knowledge-based methods.
Such overlapFirst, as observed in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) the lexical-based distance kernel Kl shows an accuracy significantly higher than the random baseline, i.e. 50%.

First, as observed in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) the lexical-based distance kernel Kl shows an accuracy significantly higher than the random baseline, i.e. 50%.
Then, we use this cross-pair similarity with more traditional intra-pair similarities (e.g. , (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005)) to define a novel kernel function.
On the other hand, Corley and Mihalcea (2005) found little difference between the measures when using them in an algorithm for computing text similarity.
Recognition and Textual Entailment A problem closely related to, and as important as, generating paraphrases is that of assigning a quantitative measurement to the semantic similarity of two phrases (Fujita and Sato 2008a) or even two given pieces of text (Corley and Mihalcea 2005; Uzuner and Katz 2005).
