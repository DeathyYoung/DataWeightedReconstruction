The use of lexical patterns to identify answers in corpus-based QA received lots of attention after a team taking part in one of the earlier QA Tracks at TREC showed that the approach was competitive at that stage (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002)
Ravichandran and Hovy (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web
, 1999); in information retrieval they have been used for query expansion (Anick and Tipirneni, 1999)
, 2006); in multi-document summarization, they have been used to identify phrases from different sentences that express the same information (Barzilay et al
Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bi-directional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al
In QA, Lin and Pantel (2001) and Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) paraphrased the answer patterns to enhance the recall of answer extraction
Accordingly, many researchers have recognized that automatic paraphrasing is an indispensable component of intelligent NLP systems (Iordanskaja et al
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns
Anchor-based learning methods have been used to investigate many semantic relations ranging from very general ones as the isa relation in (Morin, 1999) to very specific ones as in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) where paraphrases of question-answer pairs are searched in the web or as in (Szpektor et al
, 2004) where a method to scan the web for searching textual entailment prototype relations is presented
3 Contribution This paper presents LEILA (Learning to Extract Information by Linguistic Analysis), a system that can extract instances of an arbitrary given binary relation from natural language Web documents without human intervention
, in press), which has a few modifications with respect to Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)s, such as the use of the wildcard * to represent any sequence of words, and the addition of part-of-speech and Named Entity labels to the patterns
(Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web
Automatically Learning Entailment Rules from the Web Many algorithms for automatically learning paraphrases and entailment rules have been explored in recent years (Lin and Pantel, 2001; 1http://jakarta
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) reported experimental results for automatically generating surface patterns for relation identification; others have explored similar approaches (e
