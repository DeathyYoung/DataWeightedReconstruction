In this paper we explore the power of surface text patterns for open-d main question answering systems
Using the TREC-10 question set, we report results for two cases: answers determined from the TREC-10 corpus and from the web
The use of lexical patterns to identify answers in corpus-based QA received lots of attention after a team taking part in one of the earlier QA Tracks at TREC showed that the approach was competitive at that stage (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002)
(Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web
Bootstrapping approaches to information extraction can yield impressive results with little initial human effort (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Pasca et al
Agichtein & Gravano (2000) and Ravichandran & Hovy (2002) reported results for generating surface patterns for relation identification; others have explored similar approaches (e
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) proposed automatically learning surface text patterns for answer extraction
Most works that attempt to learn such concrete lexical semantic relations employ a co-occurrence pattern-based approach (Hearst, 1992; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Moldovan et al
In addition to their use for learning lexical semantic relations, patterns were commonly used to learn instances of concrete semantic relations for Information Extraction (IE) and QA, as in (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Yangarber et al
1 Introduction Automatically acquiring semantic lexicons from text is essential for overcoming the knowledge bottleneck in many NLP tasks, e
Paraphrase generation can be used for query expansion in information retrieval and question answering systems (McKeown, 1979; Anick and Tipirneni, 1999; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Riezler et al
, in press), which has a few modifications with respect to Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)s, such as the use of the wildcard * to represent any sequence of words, and the addition of part-of-speech and Named Entity labels to the patterns
Some other works (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) rely on the abundance of web data to obtain easy patterns and learn such patterns based mostly on lexical information
Pattern Learning Our approach to pattern learning is inspired by the work of Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), who propose a method to learn patterns based on a two-step technique: the first acquires patterns from the Web given a set of seeds and the second validates the patterns
