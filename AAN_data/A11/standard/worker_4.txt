, 2006); in multi-document summarization, they have been used to identify phrases from different sentences that express the same information (Barzilay et al
For example, in question answering, paraphrases have been used to find multiple patterns that pinpoint the same answer (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002); in statistical machine translation, they have been used to find translations for unseen source language phrases (Callison-Burch et al
, in press), which has a few modifications with respect to Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)s, such as the use of the wildcard * to represent any sequence of words, and the addition of part-of-speech and Named Entity labels to the patterns
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) reported experimental results for automatically generating surface patterns for relation identification; others have explored similar approaches (e
As referred to in the introduction, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present a method to identify surface text patterns using a web search engine
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns
A third approach has been to use a very small number of seed instances or patterns to do bootstrap learning (Brin, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Etzioni et al
Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bi-directional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al
Ravichandran and Hovy (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web
The use of lexical patterns to identify answers in corpus-based QA received lots of attention after a team taking part in one of the earlier QA Tracks at TREC showed that the approach was competitive at that stage (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002)
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) proposed automatically learning surface text patterns for answer extraction
We calculate the precision of each pattern, and the average precision for each question type
Patterns are then automatically extracted from the returned documents and standardized
Most works that attempt to learn such concrete lexical semantic relations employ a co-occurrence pattern-based approach (Hearst, 1992; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Moldovan et al
In QA, Lin and Pantel (2001) and Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) paraphrased the answer patterns to enhance the recall of answer extraction
