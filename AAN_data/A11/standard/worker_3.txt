In QA, Lin and Pantel (2001) and Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) paraphrased the answer patterns to enhance the recall of answer extraction
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns
As referred to in the introduction, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present a method to identify surface text patterns using a web search engine
Bootstrapping approaches to information extraction can yield impressive results with little initial human effort (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Pasca et al
Pattern Learning Our approach to pattern learning is inspired by the work of Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), who propose a method to learn patterns based on a two-step technique: the first acquires patterns from the Web given a set of seeds and the second validates the patterns
Many research ideas have exploited the Web in unsupervised or weakly supervised algorithms for natural language processing (e
Anchor-based learning methods have been used to investigate many semantic relations ranging from very general ones as the isa relation in (Morin, 1999) to very specific ones as in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) where paraphrases of question-answer pairs are searched in the web or as in (Szpektor et al
, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), they can only handle factual questions as in TREC (Voorhees, 2001), and the context for the whole task is largely not considered
Although semantics-poor techniques, such as surface pattern matching (Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) or statistical methods (Ittycheriah et al
Accordingly, many researchers have recognized that automatic paraphrasing is an indispensable component of intelligent NLP systems (Iordanskaja et al
Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bi-directional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al
The most commonly used technique in pattern-based approaches is bootstrapping (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al
Paraphrase generation can be used for query expansion in information retrieval and question answering systems (McKeown, 1979; Anick and Tipirneni, 1999; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Riezler et al
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) proposed automatically learning surface text patterns for answer extraction
A tagged corpus is built from the Internet in a bootstrapping process by providing a few hand-crafted examples of each question type to Altavista
