Accordingly, many researchers have recognized that automatic paraphrasing is an indispensable component of intelligent NLP systems (Iordanskaja et al
, in press), which has a few modifications with respect to Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)s, such as the use of the wildcard * to represent any sequence of words, and the addition of part-of-speech and Named Entity labels to the patterns
Bootstrapping approaches to information extraction can yield impressive results with little initial human effort (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Pasca et al
Although semantics-poor techniques, such as surface pattern matching (Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) or statistical methods (Ittycheriah et al
For instance, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) defined a question taxonomy for their QA system
For example, in question answering, paraphrases have been used to find multiple patterns that pinpoint the same answer (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002); in statistical machine translation, they have been used to find translations for unseen source language phrases (Callison-Burch et al
This iterative procedure has been successfully applied to a variety of NLP tasks, such as hypernym/hyponym extraction (Hearst, 1992), word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), and information extraction (Brin, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Yangarber et al
As an alternative, researchers have tried to acquire paraphrases from large-scale web corpora (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pasca and Dienes, 2005; Bhagat and Ravichandran, 2008) or directly based on web mining (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002)
Paraphrase generation can be used for query expansion in information retrieval and question answering systems (McKeown, 1979; Anick and Tipirneni, 1999; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Riezler et al
We calculate the precision of each pattern, and the average precision for each question type
Patterns are then automatically extracted from the returned documents and standardized
Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bi-directional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns
For example, the simple subordinate clause in the following example (taken from (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002)) can already prevent a surface pattern matcher from discovering a relation between London and the river Thames: London, which has one of the busiest airports in the world, lies on the banks of the river Thames
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) reported experimental results for automatically generating surface patterns for relation identification; others have explored similar approaches (e
