In this paper we explore the power of surface text patterns for open-d main question answering systems.  In order to obtain an optimal set of patterns, we have developed a method for learning such patterns automatically. A tagged corpus is built from the Internet in a bootstrapping process by providing a few hand-crafted examples of each question type to Altavista. Patterns are then automatically extracted from the returned documents and standardized. We calculate the precision of each pattern, and the average precision for each question type. These patterns are then applied to find answers to new questions.  Using the TREC-10 question set, we report results for two cases: answers determined from the TREC-10 corpus and from the web.

Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns.

For example, the year of birth of a person is typically expressed using one of these phrases: was born in () We have developed a method to learn such patterns automatically from text on the web (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002). (self citation)

Title:P03-1001		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Fleischman, Michael; Hovy, Eduard; Echihabi, Abdessamad
These patterns could be manually generated, such as the ones described here, or learned from text, as described in Ravichandran and Hovy (2002). (self citation)

Although semantics-poor techniques, such as surface pattern matching (Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) or statistical methods (Ittycheriah et al. , 2002), have been successful in answering factoid questions, more complex tasks require a consideration of text meaning.

In this paper, we employ and extend the method described by Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) shown in Figure 1.

Title:W03-0405		Conference:Conference On Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL		Author:Mann, Gideon S.; Yarowsky, David
In particular, the methodology proposed by Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) requires no parsing or other language specific resources, so is an ideal candidate for multilingual use.

1 Introduction Several QA systems have investigated the use of text patterns for QA (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2001), (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002), (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002). (self citation)

Title:W03-1609		Conference:International Workshop On Paraphrasing IWP		Author:Shinyama, Yusuke; Sekine, Satoshi
(Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) used pairs of questions and answers to obtain varied patterns which give the same answer.

Title:P04-1053		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Hasegawa, Takaaki; Sekine, Satoshi; Grishman, Ralph
Ravichandran also explored a similar method for question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Title:C04-1188		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics		Author:Jijkoun, Valentin; Mur, Jori; de Rijke, Maarten
The use of lexical patterns to identify answers in corpus-based QA received lots of attention after a team taking part in one of the earlier QA Tracks at TREC showed that the approach was competitive at that stage (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Title:P05-1060		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Mann, Gideon S.; Yarowsky, David
For the special case of Rote extractors, a more attractive alternative has been proposed by Brin (1998), Agichtein and Gravano (2000), and Ravichandran and Hovy (2002).

Title:W05-0205		Conference:Workshop On Building Educational Applications Using NLP		Author:Xuan, Weijian; Zhang, Meilan
While some QA systems are promising (Harabagiu, et al. , 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), they can only handle factual questions as in TREC (Voorhees, 2001), and the context for the whole task is largely not considered.

Title:H05-1039		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Peng, Fuchun; Weischedel, Ralph M.; Licuanan, Ana; Xu, Jinxi
Automatic pattern derivation is more appealing (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Title:P05-1014		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhitomirsky-Geffet, Maayan; Dagan, Ido
Most works that attempt to learn such concrete lexical semantic relations employ a co-occurrence pattern-based approach (Hearst, 1992; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Moldovan et al. , 2004).

Title:P05-1014		Conference:Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zhitomirsky-Geffet, Maayan; Dagan, Ido
A few recent works (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Keller et al. , 2002; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) used the web to collect statistics on word cooccurrences.

Title:W05-1207		Conference:Workshop On Empirical Modeling Of Semantic Equivalence And Entailment		Author:Zanzotto, Fabio Massimo; Pazienza, Maria Teresa; Pennacchiotti, Marco
These retrieved text fragments are then considered good candidate for paraphrasing X bought Y. Anchor-based learning methods have been used to investigate many semantic relations ranging from very general ones as the isa relation in (Morin, 1999) to very specific ones as in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) where paraphrases of question-answer pairs are searched in the web or as in (Szpektor et al. , 2004) where a method to scan the web for searching textual entailment prototype relations is presented.

Title:H05-1088		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Sauri, Roser; Knippen, Robert; Verhagen, Marc; Pustejovsky, James
In this field as well, the use of pre-defined sets of relation patterns has proved fairly reliable, particularly in the case of factoid type queries (Brill et al. , 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Hovy et al. , 2002; Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002).

Title:H05-1075		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Feng, Donghui; Hovy, Eduard
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) proposed automatically learning surface text patterns for answer extraction. (self citation)

Title:H05-1075		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Feng, Donghui; Hovy, Eduard
But it is almost impossible to learn such surface text patterns following (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002). (self citation)

Title:P06-1100		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Pennacchiotti, Marco; Pantel, Patrick
Many recent efforts have also focused on extracting binary semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (Szpektor et al. 2004), is-a (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002), part-of (Girju et al. 2003), and other relations.

Title:W06-3807		Conference:TextGraphs Workshop On Graph Based Methods For Natural Language Processing		Author:Molla Aliod, Diego
For example, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) learns rules based on simple surface patterns.

Title:W06-3807		Conference:TextGraphs Workshop On Graph Based Methods For Natural Language Processing		Author:Molla Aliod, Diego
To obtain such a corpus Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) mine the Web to gather the relevant data.

Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) evaluated the performance of a QA system that is based solely on paraphrases, an approach resembling ours.

Title:P06-1136		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Chen, Yi; Zhou, Ming; Wang, Shilong
i.e., for Who is ? question, we add the word biography; and for What is ? question, we add the word is usually, refers to, etc. We learn these clue words using the similar method proposed in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Title:N06-1039		Conference:Human Language Technology Conference And Meeting Of The North American Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Shinyama, Yusuke; Sekine, Satoshi
Several existing works have tried to extract a certain type of relation by manually choosing different pairs of entities (Brin, 1998; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Title:P06-1015		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Pantel, Patrick; Pennacchiotti, Marco
Many recent efforts have also focused on extracting semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (Szpektor et al. 2004), is-a (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002), part-of (Girju et al. 2006), and other relations.

Title:P06-1015		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Pantel, Patrick; Pennacchiotti, Marco
We chose the state of the art algorithm described in (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) with the following slight modification.

Title:P06-1015		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Pantel, Patrick; Pennacchiotti, Marco
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) focus on scaling relation extraction to the Web.

Title:P06-1015		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Pantel, Patrick; Pennacchiotti, Marco
As in the original algorithm, all substrings linking terms x and y are then extracted from S x,y, and overall frequencies are computed to form P. Pattern Ranking/Selection In (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002), a frequency threshold on the patterns in P is set to select the final patterns.

The approach followed for the generalisation is the one described by (Alfonseca et al. , 2006a; Ruiz-Casado et al. , in press), which has a few modifications with respect to Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)s, such as the use of the wildcard * to represent any sequence of words, and the addition of part-of-speech and Named Entity labels to the patterns.

Title:W06-0507		Conference:Workshop On Ontology Learning And Population: Bridging The Gap Between Text And Knowledge		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Ruiz-Casado, Maria; Okumura, Manabu; Castells, Pablo
Several similar approaches have been proposed (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), with various applications: Question-Answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), multi-document Named Entity Coreference (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003), and generating biographical information (Mann and Yarowsky, 2005).

Title:W06-0507		Conference:Workshop On Ontology Learning And Population: Bridging The Gap Between Text And Knowledge		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Ruiz-Casado, Maria; Okumura, Manabu; Castells, Pablo
This may just be the m characters to the left or to the right (Brin, 1998), the longest common substring of several contexts (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), or all substrings obtained with a suffix tree constructor (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Title:W06-0507		Conference:Workshop On Ontology Learning And Population: Bridging The Gap Between Text And Knowledge		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Ruiz-Casado, Maria; Okumura, Manabu; Castells, Pablo
For example, the following patterns are reported by Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) for identifying the relations Inventor, Discoverer and Location: Relation Prec.

Title:W06-0507		Conference:Workshop On Ontology Learning And Population: Bridging The Gap Between Text And Knowledge		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Ruiz-Casado, Maria; Okumura, Manabu; Castells, Pablo
We assume that the system has used the seed list to extract and generalise a set of patterns for each of the relations using training corpora (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Alfonseca et al. , 2006a).

Title:W06-0507		Conference:Workshop On Ontology Learning And Population: Bridging The Gap Between Text And Knowledge		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Ruiz-Casado, Maria; Okumura, Manabu; Castells, Pablo
Consequently, rote extractors (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) have been identified as an appropriate method to look for textual contexts that happen to convey a certain relation between two concepts.

Title:W06-0507		Conference:Workshop On Ontology Learning And Population: Bridging The Gap Between Text And Knowledge		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Ruiz-Casado, Maria; Okumura, Manabu; Castells, Pablo
In order to train a Rote extractor from the web, this procedure is mostly used (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002): 1.

Title:W06-1656		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Feldman, Ronen; Rosenfeld, Benjamin
(Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web.

Title:W06-1656		Conference:Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing		Author:Feldman, Ronen; Rosenfeld, Benjamin
This makes URES patterns much more general, and allows to recognize instances in sentences inaccessible to the simple surface patterns of systems such as (Brin 1998; Riloff and Jones 1999; Ravichandran and Hovy 2002).

Title:P06-2075		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Mirkin, Shachar; Dagan, Ido; Zhitomirsky-Geffet, Maayan
In addition to their use for learning lexical semantic relations, patterns were commonly used to learn instances of concrete semantic relations for Information Extraction (IE) and QA, as in (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Yangarber et al. , 2000).

An interesting approach is that of rote extractors (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), which look for textual contexts that happen to convey a certain relationship between two concepts.

Title:P06-2002		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Castells, Pablo; Okumura, Manabu; Ruiz-Casado, Maria
In this case, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)s patterns resulted more precise as they do not contain disjunctions or wildcards.

Title:P06-2002		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Castells, Pablo; Okumura, Manabu; Ruiz-Casado, Maria
It is interesting to note that, as could be expected, for those targets for which there is no entity type defined (films, books and pictures), Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)s extracts many errors, because it is not possible to apply the Named Entity Recognizer to clean up the results, and the accuracy remains below 10%.

Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) have noted that this might be dangerous if the wildcard matches unrestrictedly incorrect sentences.

In order to train a Rote extractor from the web, this procedure is usually followed (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002): 1.

Title:P06-2002		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics - Poster Sessions		Author:Alfonseca, Enrique; Castells, Pablo; Okumura, Manabu; Ruiz-Casado, Maria
For instance, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) report the following patterns for the relationships Inventor, Discoverer and Location: Relation Prec.

Title:W06-2208		Conference:Workshop On Adaptive Text Extraction And Mining ATEM		Author:Tomita, Junji; Soderland, Stephen; Etzioni, Oren
This idea is based on that of (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) for a QA system.

Title:W06-0208		Conference:Workshop On Information Extraction Beyond The Document		Author:Patwardhan, Siddharth; Riloff, Ellen
Many research ideas have exploited the Web in unsupervised or weakly supervised algorithms for natural language processing (e.g. , Resnik (1999), Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), Keller and Lapata (2003)).

Title:W06-0208		Conference:Workshop On Information Extraction Beyond The Document		Author:Patwardhan, Siddharth; Riloff, Ellen
Indeed, many researchers have recently tapped the Web as a data-source for improving performance on NLP tasks (e.g. , Resnik (1999), Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), Keller and Lapata (2003)).

For example, the simple subordinate clause in the following example (taken from (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002)) can already prevent a surface pattern matcher from discovering a relation between London and the river Thames: London, which has one of the busiest airports in the world, lies on the banks of the river Thames. 1.3 Contribution This paper presents LEILA (Learning to Extract Information by Linguistic Analysis), a system that can extract instances of an arbitrary given binary relation from natural language Web documents without human intervention.

Title:W06-0503		Conference:Workshop On Ontology Learning And Population: Bridging The Gap Between Text And Knowledge		Author:Suchanek, Fabian M.; Ifrim, Georgiana; Weikum, Gerhard
The only group that can learn arbitrary binary relations is the group of pattern matching systems (Etzioni et al. , 2004; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Brin, 1999; Soderland, 1999; Xu et al. , 2002; Ruiz-Casado et al. , 2005; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005).

Title:W06-2201		Conference:Workshop On Adaptive Text Extraction And Mining ATEM		Author:Geleijnse, Gijs; Korst, Jan
As referred to in the introduction, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present a method to identify surface text patterns using a web search engine.

Title:P06-1107		Conference:International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics		Author:Zanzotto, Fabio Massimo; Pennacchiotti, Marco; Pazienza, Maria Teresa
More recently this method has been applied for structuring terminology in isa hierarchies (Morin, 1999) and for learning question-answering patterns (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Title:P07-1076		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Rosenfeld, Benjamin; Feldman, Ronen
Ravichandran and Hovy (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web.

Title:P07-1076		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Rosenfeld, Benjamin; Feldman, Ronen
This makes SRES patterns more general, and allows to recognize instances in sentences inaccessible to the simple surface patterns of systems such as (Brin 1998; Riloff and Jones 1999; Ravichandran and Hovy 2002).

2.2 Evaluation of Acquisition Algorithms Many methods for automatic acquisition of rules have been suggested in recent years, ranging from distributional similarity to finding shared contexts (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al. , 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Szpektor et al. , 2004; Sekine, 2005).

Title:P07-1058		Conference:45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Szpektor, Idan; Shnarch, Eyal; Dagan, Ido
One approach which was used for evaluating automatically acquired rules is to measure their contribution to the performance of specific systems, such as QA (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) or IE (Sudo et al. , 2003; Romano et al. , 2006).

Title:N07-2032		Conference:Human Language Technologies 2007: The Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics; Companion Volume, Short Papers		Author:Nguyen, Dat P. T.; Matsuo, Yutaka; Ishizuka, Mitsuru
Some other works (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) rely on the abundance of web data to obtain easy patterns and learn such patterns based mostly on lexical information.

5 Related Work Techniques for information extraction from minimally supervised data have been explored by Brin (1998), Agichtein and Gravano (2000), and Ravichandran and Hovy (2002).

Automatically Learning Entailment Rules from the Web Many algorithms for automatically learning paraphrases and entailment rules have been explored in recent years (Lin and Pantel, 2001; 1http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html 67 Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al. , 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Sudo et al. , 2003; Szpektor et al. , 2004; Satoshi, 2005).

Title:W07-0909		Conference:Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage Data (LaTeCH 2007)		Author:Szpektor, Idan; Dagan, Ido; Lavie, Alon; Shacham, Danny; Wintner, Shuly
Although knowledge-bases of entailment-rules and paraphrases learned by acquisition algorithms were used in other NLP applications, such as QA (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) and IE (Sudo et al. , 2003; Romano et al. , 2006), to the best of our knowledge the output of such algorithms was never applied to IR before.

To do so, Espresso uses a slight modification of the state of the art algorithm described in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bi-directional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).

The second and more closely related class deals with extracting specific facts such as birthplace, occupation, etc. For this task, the primary theme of work in the literature has been to treat the task as a general semantic-class learning problem where one starts with a few seeds of the semantic relationship of interest and learns contextual patterns such as was born in or (born ) (Hearst, 1992; Riloff, 1996; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Mann and Yarowsky, 2003; Jijkoun et al., 2004; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005; Alfonseca et al., 2006; Pasca et al., 2006).

Given the attribute values of the seed names and their text articles, the probability of a relationship r(Attribute Name), given the surrounding context A1 p A2 q A3, where p and q are and respectively, is given using the rote extractor model probability as in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Mann and Yarowsky 2005): 2The seed examples were chosen randomly, with a bias against duplicate attribute values to increase training diversity.

The rows with subscript RH02in Table 4 shows the performance of this Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) model with additional attribute domain modeling for each attribute, and Table 3 shows the average performance across all attributes.

Title:E09-1035		Conference:EACL		Author:Garera, Nikesh; Yarowsky, David
Such templatic patterns can be learned using seed examples of the attribute in question and, there has been a plethora of work in the seed-based bootstrapping literature which addresses this problem (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005; Alfonseca et al., 2006; Pasca et al., 2006) Thus for our baseline we implemented a standard Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) pattern learning model using 100 seed2 examples from an online biographic database called NNDB (http://www.nndb.com) for each of the biographic attributes: Birthdate, Birthplace, Deathdate, Gender, Nationality, Occupation and Religion.

Bootstrapping approaches to information extraction can yield impressive results with little initial human effort (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Pasca et al., 2006).

Title:P09-1031		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Yang, Hui; Callan, James, P.
The most commonly used technique in pattern-based approaches is bootstrapping (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al., 2005; Girju et al., 2003; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).

Title:P09-1031		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Yang, Hui; Callan, James, P.
Other types of relations that have been studied by pattern-based approaches include questionanswer relations (such as birthdates and inventor) (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), synonyms and antonyms (Lin et al., 2003), general purpose analogy (Turney et al., 2003), verb relations (including similarity, strength, antonym, enablement and temporal) (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), entailment (Szpektor et al., 2004), and more specific relations, such as purpose, creation (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007), LivesIn, and EmployedBy (Bunescu and Mooney , 2007).

Title:P09-1113		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Mintz, Mike; Bills, Steven; Snow, Rion; Jurafsky, Daniel
A third approach has been to use a very small number of seed instances or patterns to do bootstrap learning (Brin, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008).

Title:P09-1113		Conference:ACL-IJCNLP		Author:Mintz, Mike; Bills, Steven; Snow, Rion; Jurafsky, Daniel
such as Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) and Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006) use the same formalism of learning regular expressions over words and part-of-speech tags to discover patterns indicating a variety of relations.

Title:C10-2137		Conference:COLING - POSTERS		Author:Sun, Ang; Grishman, Ralph
This iterative procedure has been successfully applied to a variety of NLP tasks, such as hypernym/hyponym extraction (Hearst, 1992), word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), and information extraction (Brin, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Yangarber et al., 2000; Chen and Ji, 2009).

1 Introduction Automatically acquiring semantic lexicons from text is essential for overcoming the knowledge bottleneck in many NLP tasks, e.g. question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Title:C10-1148		Conference:COLING		Author:Zhao, Shiqi; Wang, Haifeng; Liu, Ting
As an alternative, researchers have tried to acquire paraphrases from large-scale web corpora (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pasca and Dienes, 2005; Bhagat and Ravichandran, 2008) or directly based on web mining (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) reported experimental results for automatically generating surface patterns for relation identification; others have explored similar approaches (e.g. Agichtein & Gravano 2000 or Pantel & Pennacchiotti, 2006).

Title:C10-1057		Conference:COLING		Author:Jain, Alpa; Pantel, Patrick
Recent work has also explored extraction-related issues such as, scalability (Pasca et al., 2006; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Pantel et al., 2004; Etzioni et al., 2004), learning extraction schemas (Cafarella et al., 2007a; Banko et al., 2007), and organizing extracted facts (Cafarella et al., 2007b).

Pattern Learning Our approach to pattern learning is inspired by the work of Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), who propose a method to learn patterns based on a two-step technique: the first acquires patterns from the Web given a set of seeds and the second validates the patterns.

Title:W11-2705		Conference:Proceedings of the UCNLG+Eval: Language Generation and Evaluation Workshop		Author:Curto, S&eacute;rgio; Mendes, Ana Cristina; Coheur, Lu&iacute;sa
The use of patterns is a widely accepted as an effective approach in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), in tasks like Question-Answering (QA) (Soubbotin, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) or Question Generation (QG) (Wyse and Piwek, 2009; Mendes et al., 2011).

Agichtein & Gravano (2000) and Ravichandran & Hovy (2002) reported results for generating surface patterns for relation identification; others have explored similar approaches (e.g. Pantel & Pennacchiotti, 2006).

Title:D11-1133		Conference:EMNLP		Author:Freedman, Marjorie; Ramshaw, Lance A.; Boschee, Elizabeth; Gabbard, Ryan; Kratkiewicz, Gary; Ward, Nicolas; Weischedel, Ralph M.
Most approaches to automatic pattern generation have focused on precision, e.g., Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) report results in TREC QA, where extracting one instance of a relation can be sufficient, rather than detecting all instances.

Relation types and labels are then deduced from the most common patterns (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Culotta et al, 2006).
