We present a novel sentence reduction system for automatically removing extraneous phrases from sentences that are extracted from a document for summarization purpose.
The system uses multiple sources of knowledge to decide which phrases in an extracted sentence can be removed, including syn- tactic knowledge, context information, and statistics computed from a corpus which consists of examples written by human professionals. 
Reduction can sig- nificantly improve the conciseness of automatic sum- maries. 
Motivation Current automatic summarizers usually rely on sen- tence extraction to produce summaries. 
Human pro- fessionals also often reuse the input documents to generate summaries; however, rather than simply extracting sentences and stringing them together, as most current summarizers
Since we only use shallow methods for textual analysis that do not generate a. dependency structure, we cannot use complex methods for text reduction as described, e.g., in (Jing, 2000).
Jing (2000) proposes a novel algorithm for sentence reduction that takes into account different sources of information to decide whether or not to remove a particular component from a sentence to be included in a summary.
Between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Mahesh 1997; Carroll et al. 1998; Grefenstette 1998; Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002) and document compression (Daume III and Marcu 2002; Daume III and Marcu 2004; Zajic, Dorr, and Schwartz 2004) in which words, phrases, and sentences are selected in an extraction process.
In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (Jing, 2000).
1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a single given sentence, so that the new form is grammatical and retains the most important information of the original one (Jing, 2000).
The conciseness can be improved when sentence extraction is interfaced with sentence compression, where words and clauses are deleted based on rules typically operating over parsed input (Jing, 2000; Daume III and Marcu, 2002; Lin, 2003; Daume III, 2006; Zajic et al., 2007; Martins and Smith, 2009).
A syntactic approach considers the alignment over parse trees (Jing, 2000), and a similar technique has been used with dependency trees to evaluate the quality of sentence fusions (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005).
To overcome this problem, linguistic parsing and generation systems are used in the sentence condensation approaches of Knight and Marcu (2000) and Jing (2000).
Jing and McKeown(H. Jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed.
Depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence headlines for multi-sentence text (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing, 2000).
