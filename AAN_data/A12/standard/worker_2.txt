We present a novel sentence reduction system for automatically removing extraneous phrases from sentences that are extracted from a document for summarization purpose.
The system uses multiple sources of knowledge to decide which phrases in an extracted sentence can be removed, including syn- tactic knowledge, context information, and statistics computed from a corpus which consists of examples written by human professionals. 
Reduction can sig- nificantly improve the conciseness of automatic sum- maries. 
Motivation Current automatic summarizers usually rely on sen- tence extraction to produce summaries. 
Human pro- fessionals also often reuse the input documents to generate summaries; however, rather than simply extracting sentences and stringing them together, as most current summarizers
Sentence simplification systems (Chandrasekar et al. , 1996; Mahesh, 1997; Carroll et al. , 1998; Grefenstette, 1998; Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2000) are capable of compressing long sentences by deleting unimportant words and phrases.
In contrast to Jing (2000), the bulk of the research on sentence compression relies exclusively on corpus data for modelling the compression process without recourse to extensive knowledge sources (e.g. , WordNet).
In addition, an automatic evaluation method based on context-free deletion decisions has been proposed by Jing (2000).
1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a single given sentence, so that the new form is grammatical and retains the most important information of the original one (Jing, 2000).
N03-1026:17 To overcome this problem, linguistic parsing and generation systems are used in the sentence condensation approaches of Knight and Marcu (2000) and Jing (2000).
Interfacing extractive summarization with a sentence compression module could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries and render them more informative (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003; Zajic et al., 2007).
Extractive methods are generally simpler and have dominated the sentence compression literature (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Nomoto, 2009; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010; Yamangil and Shieber, 2010).
Given the need to ensure grammatical sentences, a number of researchers have used syntax-directed approaches that perform transformations on the output of syntactic parsers (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al. , 2003).
To overcome this problem, linguistic parsing and generation systems are used in the sentence condensation approaches of Knight and Marcu (2000) and Jing (2000).
Jing and McKeown(H. Jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed.
