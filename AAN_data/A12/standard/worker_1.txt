We present a novel sentence reduction system for automatically removing extraneous phrases from sentences that are extracted from a document for summarization purpose.
The system uses multiple sources of knowledge to decide which phrases in an extracted sentence can be removed, including syn- tactic knowledge, context information, and statistics computed from a corpus which consists of examples written by human professionals. 
Reduction can sig- nificantly improve the conciseness of automatic sum- maries. 
Motivation Current automatic summarizers usually rely on sen- tence extraction to produce summaries. 
Human pro- fessionals also often reuse the input documents to generate summaries; however, rather than simply extracting sentences and stringing them together, as most current summarizers
Jing and McKeown (2000) and Jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences.
Jing (2000) proposes a novel algorithm for sentence reduction that takes into account different sources of information to decide whether or not to remove a particular component from a sentence to be included in a summary.
Many algorithms exploit parallel corpora (Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002; Riezler et al. 2003; Nguyen et al. 2004a; Turner and Charniak 2005; McDonald 2006) to learn the correspondences between long and short sentences in a supervised manner, typically using a rich feature space induced from parse trees.
Given the need to ensure grammatical sentences, a number of researchers have used syntax-directed approaches that perform transformations on the output of syntactic parsers (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al. , 2003).
Examples include the generation of subtitles from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan, 2004), the display of text on small screens such as mobile phones or PDAs (Corston-Oliver, 2001), and, notably, summarisation (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003).
The conciseness can be improved when sentence extraction is interfaced with sentence compression, where words and clauses are deleted based on rules typically operating over parsed input (Jing, 2000; Daume III and Marcu, 2002; Lin, 2003; Daume III, 2006; Zajic et al., 2007; Martins and Smith, 2009).
A syntactic approach considers the alignment over parse trees (Jing, 2000), and a similar technique has been used with dependency trees to evaluate the quality of sentence fusions (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005).
Considerations of sentence fluency are also key in sentence simplification (Siddharthan, 2003), sentence compression (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; Clarke and Lapata, 2006; McDonald, 2006; Turner and Charniak, 2005; Galley and McKeown, 2007), text re-generation for summarization (Daume III and Marcu, 2004; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Wan et al., 2005) and headline generation (Banko et al., 2000; Zajic et al., 2007; Soricut and Marcu, 2007).
Depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence headlines for multi-sentence text (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing, 2000).
1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a single given sentence, so that the new form is grammatical and retains the most important information of the original one (Jing, 2000).
