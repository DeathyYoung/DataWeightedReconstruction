We present a novel sentence reduction system for automatically removing extraneous phrases from sentences that are extracted from a document for summarization purpose. The system uses multiple sources of knowledge to decide which phrases in an extracted sentence can be removed, including syn- tactic knowledge, context information, and statistics computed from a corpus which consists of examples written by human professionals. Reduction can sig- nificantly improve the conciseness of automatic sum- maries. 1 Motivation Current automatic summarizers usually rely on sen- tence extraction to produce summaries. Human pro- fessionals also often reuse the input documents to generate summaries; however, rather than simply extracting sentences and stringing them together, as most current summarizers...

Since we only use shallow methods for textual analysis that do not generate a. dependency structure, we cannot use complex methods for text reduction as described, e.g., in (Jing, 2000).

Jing and McKeown (2000) and Jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences.

Title:J02-4005		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:Horacio Saggion (University of Sheffield, Sheffield UK);Guy Lapalme (University of Montreal, Montreal QU)
Jing (2000) proposes a novel algorithm for sentence reduction that takes into account different sources of information to decide whether or not to remove a particular component from a sentence to be included in a summary.

Jing and McKeown(H. Jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed.

Title:W03-1101		Conference:Workshop On Information Retrieval With Asian Languages		Author:Chin-Yew Lin (University of Southern California, Marina del Rey CA)
For example, Jing (2000) trained her system on a set of 500 sentences from the Benton Foundation (http://www.benton.org) and their reduced forms written by humans.

Depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence headlines for multi-sentence text (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing, 2000).

Title:N03-1026		Conference:Human Language Technologies		Author:Stefan Riezler (Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto CA);Tracy Holloway King;Richard Crouch;Annie Zaenen
To overcome this problem, linguistic parsing and generation systems are used in the sentence condensation approaches of Knight and Marcu (2000) and Jing (2000).

Title:N03-1026		Conference:Human Language Technologies		Author:Stefan Riezler (Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto CA);Tracy Holloway King;Richard Crouch;Annie Zaenen
In addition, an automatic evaluation method based on context-free deletion decisions has been proposed by Jing (2000).

Between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Mahesh 1997; Carroll et al. 1998; Grefenstette 1998; Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002) and document compression (Daume III and Marcu 2002; Daume III and Marcu 2004; Zajic, Dorr, and Schwartz 2004) in which words, phrases, and sentences are selected in an extraction process.

Our constraints are linguistically and semantically motivated in a similar fashion to the grammar checking component of Jing (2000).

In contrast to Jing (2000), the bulk of the research on sentence compression relies exclusively on corpus data for modelling the compression process without recourse to extensive knowledge sources (e.g. , WordNet).

Title:P06-1048		Conference:Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:James Clarke (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK);Mirella Lapata
Many algorithms exploit parallel corpora (Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002; Riezler et al. 2003; Nguyen et al. 2004a; Turner and Charniak 2005; McDonald 2006) to learn the correspondences between long and short sentences in a supervised manner, typically using a rich feature space induced from parse trees.

Our approach is broadly in line with prior work (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al., 2003; Riezler et al., 2003; Clarke and Lapata, 2006), in that we make use of some form of syntactic knowledge to constrain compressions we generate.

Title:C08-1018		Conference:International Conference on Computational Linguistics		Author:Trevor Cohn (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK);Mirella Lapata
In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (Jing, 2000).

Examples include the generation of subtitles from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan, 2004), the display of text on small screens such as mobile phones or PDAs (Corston-Oliver, 2001), and, notably, summarisation (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003).

Considerations of sentence fluency are also key in sentence simplification (Siddharthan, 2003), sentence compression (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; Clarke and Lapata, 2006; McDonald, 2006; Turner and Charniak, 2005; Galley and McKeown, 2007), text re-generation for summarization (Daume III and Marcu, 2004; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Wan et al., 2005) and headline generation (Banko et al., 2000; Zajic et al., 2007; Soricut and Marcu, 2007).

1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a single given sentence, so that the new form is grammatical and retains the most important information of the original one (Jing, 2000).

Title:N10-1131		Conference:Human Language Technologies		Author:Dimitrios Galanis;Ion Androutsopoulos
Most of the existing compression methods are extractive (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009).

Title:J10-3005		Conference:Computational Linguistics Journal		Author:James Clarke;Mirella Lapata
Jing (2000) uses information from the local context as evidence for and against the removal of phrases during sentence compression.

Title:D10-1050		Conference:Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing		Author:Kristian Woodsend;Yansong Feng;Mirella Lapata
The conciseness can be improved when sentence extraction is interfaced with sentence compression, where words and clauses are deleted based on rules typically operating over parsed input (Jing, 2000; Daume III and Marcu, 2002; Lin, 2003; Daume III, 2006; Zajic et al., 2007; Martins and Smith, 2009).

Title:P10-1058		Conference:Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics		Author:Kristian Woodsend;Mirella Lapata
Interfacing extractive summarization with a sentence compression module could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries and render them more informative (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003; Zajic et al., 2007).

Title:N10-1044		Conference:Human Language Technologies		Author:Kathleen R. McKeown;Sara Rosenthal;Kapil Thadani;Coleman Moore
Furthermore, since research in the related task of sentence compression has benefited from the availability of training data (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2008), we expect that the creation of this corpus might encourage the development of supervised learning techniques for automated sentence fusion.

1 Introduction Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a grammatical source (input) sentence, so that the new form will still be grammatical and it will retain the most important information of the source (Jing, 2000).

Title:W11-2701		Conference:Proceedings of the UCNLG+Eval: Language Generation and Evaluation Workshop		Author:Dimitrios Galanis;Ion Androutsopoulos
Extractive methods are generally simpler and have dominated the sentence compression literature (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Nomoto, 2009; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010; Yamangil and Shieber, 2010).
